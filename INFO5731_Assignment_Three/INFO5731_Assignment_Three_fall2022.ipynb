It contains selected highlights from not only the mini-conference but also the broader plasma physics community. Although data science has a long and rich history in plasma physics, dating back at least three decades, it is experiencing a renaissance, thanks in large part to the advances outside of plasma physics. Novel algorithms, hardware, and analytic techniques (buoyed by the open source software ecosystem) have led plasma scientists to explore ways in which the data revolution could accelerate and inform scientific discovery. Emerging data-driven methods could have a transformative effect across the full spectrum of plasma research. For fusion energy research, some areas of opportunities [item 1) in the Appendix] include using machine learning (ML) or data methods for scientific discoveries, augmented instrumentation, accelerated model development and simulations, data-informed intelligent controls of the experiment, and data-enhanced predictions.

Shortly after, Furr (2009a) published a target article here in EJP on personality psychology as a truly behavioural science and discussed the (low) prevalence, meaning, importance, and measurement of behavioural assessment (see also Furr, 2009b). Now, it is time to take stock: have we, as personality psychologists, moved towards using more behavioural assessment and understanding what people are actually doing in their personal, social, and occupational lives? Has new technology helped us achieve these goals? From the available literature, it would seem that behavioural measurement has been slowly on the rise but also that we still only rarely use actual behaviour as a data source (Nave, Feeney, & Furr, 2018). However, rapid technological advancements, the digitization of daily life, the ubiquity of data\\u2010gathering tools (e.g. smartphones), and the introduction of multi\\u2010modal sensing methodology, \\u2018big data\\u2019 applications, machine learning, and artificial intelligence approaches to psychological science promise more and perhaps even better behavioural assessment than was possible decades or even just some years ago. For example, what people speak (e.g. from audio snippets), write (e.g. on online social networks, text\\u2010massaging apps, and emails), or do (e.g. captured in videos via minicameras, geospatial movements via GPS, app usage on the smartphone and internet, gameplay, or pictures of activities posted on online social media platforms) in their daily lives yields intensive and massive amounts of data that need to be mined and modelled appropriately (Blake, Lee, de la Rosa, & Sherman, in press; Harari et al., 2016; Ilmini & Fernando, 2017; Kosinski, Stillwell, & Graepel, 2013; Onnela & Rauch, 2016; Vinciarelli & Mohammadi, 2014).

Coupled with the growing availability of remotely sensed data, geomorphology could move further toward a desk-based science and erosion of the field tradition. Using examples from coastal geomorphology, this review of ML applications argues that the development of models that are scalable and can be translated between sites is dependent on experience in the field.

Residents were exposed to all aspects of AI-ML application development, including data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Core concepts in AI-ML were taught through didactic sessions and daily collaboration with data scientists and other staff. Work during the pilot period led to 12 accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings. The DSP is a feasible, well-rounded introductory experience in AI-ML for senior radiology residents.

The incidence of cutaneous melanoma is rising worldwide. Localized melanoma is effectively cured by surgical excision, reflected in a 5-year survival rate of up to 99%. In contrast, the prognosis of metastatic melanoma patients remains poor with a 5-year survival rate of only 15\\u201320%, indicating the importance of early diagnosis. The melanoma-related cost per patient-year is 10 times higher in stage IV than in stage I disease. Early detection of melanoma can contribute to a lower financial burden on the healthcare system. A unique feature of cutaneous melanoma is the direct visibility of the tumor, potentially detectable through a simple skin examination. The diagnosis of melanoma starts with a clinical screening, followed by dermoscopy, a biopsy, and histopathological confirmation. The efficiency of this diagnostic process can possibly be improved by automated image analysis of the clinical and dermoscopic images. Current computer vision systems are predominantly based on deep learning models. Deep learning is a form of machine learning that uses multiple processing layers to automatically identify increasingly abstract patterns present in data. These models have the advantage of being fairly domain averse as model architectures can be reused for a wide variety of problem scenarios. The basic premise of these setups is that given enough labeled data and computational resources, a deep learning model is able to determine which visual properties characterize certain pathologies. Two key publications illustrate the progress made in this field. In 2017, Esteva et al. trained a convolutional neural network (CNN), a type of deep learning model, on more than 100,000 images of 2032 different diseases. The images were decomposed by the CNN starting from pixel level, and the algorithm subsequently created its own diagnostic clues. The CNN was thus not limited to man-made segmentation criteria (e.g. multiple colors, irregular vascular structures, and pseudopods) to diagnose a melanoma. The model was compared to the performance of 21 dermatologists using a combination of biopsy proven clinical and dermoscopic images. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area was used to illustrate the diagnostic ability of the CNN, integrating sensitivity and specificity, with a maximum performance of 1. The CNN had a ROC area of over 0.91, which was superior to the average dermatologist\\u2019s ROC area. Note that no clinical information was provided as input to the dermatologists. Haenssle et al. compared the diagnostic performance of 58 dermatologists with a similar CNN model as reported by Esteva et al., only leveraging image data. In a comparative cross sectional reader study, a 100-image biopsy proven test-set was used. Two levels of input data were provided to the dermatologists: dermoscopic images only or dermoscopy combined with patient age, gender, and body site. The resulting CNN ROC area was 0.86. This compared favorably with the average ( SD) ROC area of 0.79 ( 0.06) for the dermatologists based on imaging alone and of 0.82 ( 0.06) when clinical information was added. Although the above-mentioned methods obtain performance with a ROC curve superior to dermatologists, it is important to stress two properties of deep learning models before interpreting these results. First, deep learning models are data-driven. For the success of CNN models, the large datasets used to train the algorithm should be representative for the target use (e.g. cases referred to a dermatologist vs. evaluation by nonspecialists) and cover the complete spectrum of skin disorders, including images from different skin types. The training set should include images with a proven histopathological\"}, {\"paperId\": \"9b3ebb7bdfeb37cc5e18579fd680ef518afc728b\", \"abstract\": \"The advancement of science and technology has facilitated adaptation of human intelligence into its computerized platform for logical analysis of any event.

The aim of countless careers has been to build intelligent machines that can interpret the world as humans do, understand language, and learn from realworld examples. In the early part of this century, two events coincided that transformed the field of aI. The advent of widely available Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) meant that parallel processing was faster, cheaper, and more powerful. at the same time, the era of \\u2018Big Data\\u2019 \\u2013 images, text, bioinformatics, medical records, and financial transactions, among others \\u2013 was moving firmly into the mainstream, along with almost limitless data storage. These factors led to a dramatic resurgence in interest in aI in both academic circles and industries outside traditional computer science. once again, aI occupies the zeitgeist, and is poised to transform medicine at a basic science, clinical, healthcare management, and financial level. Terminology surrounding these technologies continues to evolve and can be a source of confusion for non-computer scientists. aI is broadly classified as: general aI, machines that replicate human thought, emotion, and reason (and remain, for now, in the realm of science fiction); and narrow aI, technologies that can perform specific tasks as well as, or better than, humans. Machine learning (Ml) is the study of computer algorithms that can learn complex relationships or patterns from empirical data and make accurate decisions.2 Rather than coding specific sets of instructions to accomplish a task, the machine is \\u2018trained\\u2019 using large amounts of data and algorithms that confer it the ability to learn how to perform the task. Unlike normal algorithms, it is the data that \\u2018tells\\u2019 the machine what the \\u2018good answer\\u2019 is, and learning occurs without explicit programming. Ml problems can be classified as supervised learning or unsupervised learning.3 In a supervised machine learning algorithm, such as face recognition, the machine is shown several examples of \\u2018face\\u2019 or \\u2018non-face\\u2019 and the algorithm learns to predict whether an unseen image is a face or not. In unsupervised learning, the images shown to the machine are not labelled as \\u2018face\\u2019 or \\u2018non-face\\u2019. artificial Neural Networks (aNN)4 are one group of algorithms used for machine learning. While aNNs have existed for over 60 years, they fell out of favour during the 1990s and 2000s. In the last half-decade, aNNs have had a resurgence under a new name: deep artificial networks (or \\u2018Deep learning\\u2019). aNNs are uniquely poised to take full advantage of the computational boost offered by GPUs, allowing them to crunch through data sets of enormous sizes. These range from computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, face recognition, and optical character recognition (ocR), to natural language processing and even gameplaying problems (from mastering simple atari games to the recent alphaGo victory against human grandmasters).5 aNNs work by constructing layers upon layers of simple processing units (often referred to as \\u2018neurons\\u2019), interconnected via many differentially weighted connections. aNNs are \\u2018trained\\u2019 by using backpropagation algorithms, essentially telling the machine how to alter the internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous Artificial intelligence, machine learning and the evolution of healthcare\"}, {\"paperId\": \"4b34c0a57552b531d9d56f571194df2559b76e24\", \"abstract\": \"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are trending topics. AI is a broad term that represents the general concept of machines being able to carry out decisionmaking and perform human-like complex tasks, such as problem solving, understanding languages, recognizing voices and images and other \\u201csmart\\u201d tasks. ML is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to \\u201clearn\\u201d with data, feeding the algorithm with a massive amount of data so that it can adjust and improve itself. ML is a specific subset of algorithms for AI. Both provide us with unbelievable advanced technology and tools to improve Health Care. The 2018 Chief Medical Officer\\u2019s report fully embraces AI and ML (Davies, 2018). It reminds us that big data and computing power to predict, and AI to diagnose and improve diagnostics, are already here. Examples of big data unique to the United Kingdom are efforts such as the 100 000 genomes and the 500 000 participants in the UK Biobank. The report advocates the embedding of these innovations to accelerate and implement of what works across England (Davies, 2018). Three areas have potential for the implementation of ML and AI within haematology. The first field could be in the form of decision support for incoming referrals to the haematologist. Intelligently designed software could guide referring clinicians, including General Practitioners and junior doctors, through an algorithm based on their initial query. Subsequently, based on their answers, incorporating patient specific data in the hospital system, it would suggest the next steps for investigation. High volume, low complex queries around, e.g. paraprotein, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, could be dealt with through this route. Only when there are pre-defined red flag signals, such as hypercalcaemia in cases with a paraprotein, red cell fragments in a case with low platelet count, blasts, or very urgent and/or complex queries, the algorithm will notify the on-call haematology team. It might, based on the complexity, also suggest that the referrer contacts the local haematology team or an (inter)national expert. This system will not be perfect the first time around, but, like a good assistant, will need to be trained. Communication could take place through innovative secure messaging applications, such as Forward (www. forwardhealth.co), enabling the exchange of patient-identifiable information, rather than old fashioned pagers or (unsafe) WhatsApp to then further distinguish urgent from nonurgent queries. Secondly, ML and AI could be used in automated blood film reporting. The initial step is to digitize all blood films, which is already technically possible. The major National Institute for Health Research bioresource hub in Milton Keynes does this on all samples processed. This is generating a vast library of normal and abnormal blood films needed for automation. In a next step, an intelligent system will also cross check clinical records, biochemistry results and pharmacy notes. In addition, it could then use pattern recognition to decide if human interference is required because it doesn\\u2019t fit any category. These films, and any set as urgent flags, would be distributed with a provisional report to yourself via email or app on your phone. All other automated reported film reports would be sent in the same way as electrocardiogram reports are sent now, but wait in a non-urgent queue on your devices. Thirdly, modelling based on large data sets could aid in prediction and risk stratification. The systems will integrate the many data points routinely collected. It could, for instance, assist in improved prediction regarding how laboratory parameters will develop, e.g. paraprotein levels and white blood counts in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). This could aid in deciding which MGUS or CML patient needs to be seen every 3 months versus every 6 months, or even every 12 months, beyond the classical markers, making more efficient use of outpatient clinic time. But also, based on data integration, it will be more accurate to predict when a patient is going to encounter complications of therapy or recover their cell counts. This will be a very useful tool to anticipate these complications and thus improve patient outcome.

A systematic literature search using the terms \\u201cArtificial intelligence\\u201d, \\u201cHaematology\\u201d, and \\u201cHematology\\u201d revealed that in the last 5 years only 12 papers with original work have been published (L.

Recent findings Digital health including artificial intelligence-based/machine learning-based technology has made significant inroads into various aspects of healthcare including neurological care. Surveys of physicians and healthcare stakeholders suggests an overall positive perception about the benefits of artificial intelligence/machine learning in clinical practice. This positive perception is tempered by concerns for lack of knowledge and limited opportunities to build competence in artificial intelligence/machine learning technology. Literature about neurologist's perception and preparedness towards artificial intelligence/machine learning-based technology is scant. There are very few opportunities for physicians particularly neurologists to learn about artificial intelligence/machine learning-based technology.

A common misconception is that the environmental sciences are immune to such unintended consequences when AI is being used, as most data come from observations, and AI algorithms are based on mathematical formulas, which are often seen as objective. In this article, we argue the opposite can be the case. Using specific examples, we demonstrate many ways in which the use of AI can introduce similar consequences in the environmental sciences.

Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context.

Materials and Methods Using the MeSH keywords: artificial intelligence (AI), dentistry, AI in dentistry, neural networks and dentistry, machine learning, AI dental imaging, and AI treatment recommendations and dentistry. Two investigators performed an electronic search in 5 databases: PubMed/MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine), Scopus (Elsevier), ScienceDirect databases (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), and the Cochrane Collaboration (Wiley). The English language articles reporting on AI in different dental specialties were screened for eligibility. Thirty-two full-text articles were selected and systematically analyzed according to a predefined inclusion criterion. These articles were analyzed as per a specific research question, and the relevant data based on article general characteristics, study and control groups, assessment methods, outcomes, and quality assessment were extracted. Results The initial search identified 175 articles related to AI in dentistry based on the title and abstracts. The full text of 38 articles was assessed for eligibility to exclude studies not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Six articles not related to AI in dentistry were excluded. Thirty-two articles were included in the systematic review. It was revealed that AI provides accurate patient management, dental diagnosis, prediction, and decision making. Artificial intelligence appeared as a reliable modality to enhance future implications in the various fields of dentistry, i.e., diagnostic dentistry, patient management, head and neck cancer, restorative dentistry, prosthetic dental sciences, orthodontics, radiology, and periodontics. Conclusion The included studies describe that AI is a reliable tool to make dental care smooth, better, time-saving, and economical for practitioners. AI benefits them in fulfilling patient demand and expectations. The dentists can use AI to ensure quality treatment, better oral health care outcome, and achieve precision. AI can help to predict failures in clinical scenarios and depict reliable solutions. However, AI is increasing the scope of state-of-the-art models in dentistry but is still under development. Further studies are required to assess the clinical performance of AI techniques in dentistry.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"38f41c7a64530dbee6223d87306eff24681c6508\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"63479d3e148f414b3c5e0ee96264d5faae770b60\", \"abstract\": \"The documentation and protection of archaeological and cultural heritage (ACH) using remote sensing, a non-destructive tool, is increasingly popular for experts around the world, as it allows rapid searching and mapping at multiple scales, rapid analysis of multi-source data sets, and dynamic monitoring of ACH sites and their environments. The exploitation of remote sensing data and their products have seen an increased use in recent years in the fields of archaeological science and cultural heritage. Different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to distinguish archaeological remains and detect changes in the landscape over time, and, in the last decade, archaeologists have adopted more thoroughly automated object detection approaches for potential sites. These approaches included, among others, object detection methods, such as those of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning (DL) models using aerial and satellite images, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), multispectral, hyperspectral images, and active methods (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)).

The rapid growth of data collection and linking capabilities combined with the increasing diversity of the data-driven AI techniques, including machine learning (ML), has brought both ubiquitous opportunities for data analytics projects and increased demands for the regulation and accountability of the outcomes of these projects. As a result, the area of interpretability and explainability of ML is gaining significant research momentum. While there has been some progress in the development of ML methods, the methodological side has shown limited progress. This limits the practicality of using ML in the health domain: the issues with explaining the outcomes of ML algorithms to medical practitioners and policy makers in public health has been a recognized obstacle to the broader adoption of data science approaches in this domain. This study builds on the earlier work which introduced CRISP-ML, a methodology that determines the interpretability level required by stakeholders for a successful real-world solution and then helps in achieving it. CRISP-ML was built on the strengths of CRISP-DM, addressing the gaps in handling interpretability. Its application in the Public Healthcare sector follows its successful deployment in a number of recent real-world projects across several industries and fields, including credit risk, insurance, utilities, and sport. This study elaborates on the CRISP-ML methodology on the determination, measurement, and achievement of the necessary level of interpretability of ML solutions in the Public Healthcare sector. It demonstrates how CRISP-ML addressed the problems with data diversity, the unstructured nature of data, and relatively low linkage between diverse data sets in the healthcare domain. The characteristics of the case study, used in the study, are typical for healthcare data, and CRISP-ML managed to deliver on these issues, ensuring the required level of interpretability of the ML solutions discussed in the project. The approach used ensured that interpretability requirements were met, taking into account public healthcare specifics, regulatory requirements, project stakeholders, project objectives, and data characteristics.

Various decline curve models have been applied for unconventional wells, including the Arps model, stretched exponential model, Duong model, and combined capacitance-resistance model. However, it is not straightforward to determine which model should be used, as multiple models may fit a dataset equally well but provide different forecasts, and hastily selecting a model for probabilistic DCA can underestimate the uncertainty in a production forecast. Data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing the oil and gas industry by utilizing computing power more effectively and efficiently. We propose a data-driven approach in this paper to performing short term predictions for unconventional oil production. Two states of the art level models have tested: DeepAR and used Prophet time series analysis on petroleum production data. Compared with the traditional approach using decline curve models, the machine learning approach can be regarded as\\u201d model-free\\u201d (non-parametric) because the pre-determination of decline curve models is not required. The main goal of this work is to develop and apply neural networks and time series techniques to oil well data without having substantial knowledge regarding the extraction process or physical relationship between the geological and dynamic parameters. For evaluation and verification purpose, The proposed method is applied to a selected well of Midland fields from the USA. By comparing our results, we can infer that both DeepAR and Prophet analysis are useful for gaining a better understanding of the behavior of oil wells, and can mitigate over/underestimates resulting from using a single decline curve model for forecasting. In addition, the proposed approach performs well in spreading model uncertainty to uncertainty in production forecasting; that is, we end up with a forecast which outperforms the standard DCA methods.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"38be58a9f51ed2af7e9e75793c38529de8aa5267\", \"abstract\": \"Machine learning is a subcategory of artificial intelligence, which aims to make computers capable of solving complex problems without being explicitly programmed.

When shared data is later used in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems or machine learning (ML) models, the trust lineage extends to the users of the system, typically practitioners in fields such as healthcare and finance.

Purpose To evaluate the reported performance of stand-alone ML applications for screening mammography workflow. Materials and Methods Ovid Embase, Ovid Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science literature databases were searched for relevant studies published from January 2012 to September 2020. The study was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (protocol no. CRD42019156016). Stand-alone technology was defined as a ML algorithm that can be used independently of a human reader. Studies were quality assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool, and reporting was evaluated using the Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging. A primary meta-analysis included the top-performing algorithm and corresponding reader performance from which pooled summary estimates for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated using a bivariate model. Results Fourteen articles were included, which detailed 15 studies for stand-alone detection (n = 8) and triage (n = 7). Triage studies reported that 17%-91% of normal mammograms identified could be read by adapted screening, while \\\"missing\\\" an estimated 0%-7% of cancers. In total, an estimated 185\\u2009252 cases from three countries with more than 39 readers were included in the primary meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC was 75.4% (95% CI: 65.6, 83.2; P = .11), 90.6% (95% CI: 82.9, 95.0; P = .40), and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.98), respectively, for algorithms, and 73.0% (95% CI: 60.7, 82.6), 88.6% (95% CI: 72.4, 95.8), and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.97), respectively, for readers. Conclusion Machine learning (ML) algorithms that demonstrate a stand-alone application in mammographic screening workflows achieve or even exceed human reader detection performance and improve efficiency.

It arises at the intersection of data science and computer science and aims at the efficiency of computing algorithms. In cancer research, ML has been increasingly used in predictive prognostic models. DL is defined as a subset of ML targeting multilayer computation processes. DL is less dependent on the understanding of data features than ML. Therefore, the algorithms of DL are much more difficult to interpret than ML, even potentially impossible. This review discussed the role of AI in the diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic advances of gastric cancer. Models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or artificial neural networks (ANNs) achieved significant praise in their application. There is much more to be fully covered across the clinical administration of gastric cancer. Despite growing efforts, adapting AI to improving diagnoses for gastric cancer is a worthwhile venture. The information yield can revolutionize how we approach gastric cancer problems. Though integration might be slow and labored, it can be given the ability to enhance diagnosing through visual modalities and augment treatment strategies. It can grow to become an invaluable tool for physicians. AI not only benefits diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes, but also reshapes perspectives over future medical trajectory.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"4a0a86fe5314d4404520b494f91d04889e615976\", \"abstract\": \"The case focusses on Rho AI, a data science firm, and its attempt to leverage artificial intelligence to encourage environmental, social and governance investments to limit the impact of climate change.

For a computational system to be artificially intelligent, the system should possess the ability to understand the surrounding environment, make proper assumptions, and based on the circumstances make judicious decisions that maximize the possibilities of accomplishing goals most of the time. These AI\\u2010enabled devices are also called Intelligent Agents. These intelligent agents use some mapping functions also termed cognitive functions, which take these environmental parameters and contextual information as inputs along with the goal to be accomplished and manipulate the right means to accomplish the targeted goal. AI can also be considered inter\\u2010 disciplinary as it involves several other disciplines such as Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Cognitive Science, Neural Networks, Data Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP), robotics, and mathematics. All these disciplines are related, and thereby intelligent agents are trained to understand and adapt to the surrounding environment according to the context. The use of AI spans across several applications such as Human\\u2013Computer Interaction (HCI) based smart agent development, devising smart surveillance solutions using computer vision, creating robust and stable decision making systems that can understand, evaluate, manipulate, analyze, and predict several novel patterns by processing large volumes of application data, development of multilingual systems that uses NLP to understand the language features used across the context and aid decision making and so on. Also, since its inception as an academic discipline in the 1950s, AI has grown leaps and bounds as a discipline, and its applications have stretched across several domains such as Retail and Business solutions, Manufacturing and Logistics, Automobiles, Business Analytics and Market predictions, Healthcare, Security Systems, and Education. One of the key emerging areas where extensive efforts are spent towards developing smart applications and agents is the educational domain. Gone are the days where the educational system was completely driven by humans, and the growth of AI\\u2010enabled intelligent agents has set the tone by replacing most human work with that of smart agents. Educational systems use AI\\u2010based agents to study the behavior of students and suggest suitable courses for them. Smart agents are nowadays deployed in classrooms for complete classroom monitoring that includes tracking attendance, monitoring classroom activities, student and staff behavior monitoring, and so on. Similarly, smart agents are deployed to scan through the contents available online and suggest suitable content to students according to the course and also according to the different levels of understanding of student fraternity. Also, computer vision\\u2010based smart agents are deployed to study the state of mind of students when they undergo different courses and provide insightful information about their likeness towards a subject or course. This agent\\u2010based information serves as useful information in deciding the teaching methodology and also framing of course contents. Also, smart systems play a vital role in analyzing student results and providing insightful information about student performance. Thus, it is imperative that AI has become an indispensable force to reckon with in the future forward across the educational domain. However, the major drawback in these artificially intelligent systems is that they are not always accurate with decision making and at times predict otherwise. Also, training the AI\\u2010based agent to understand the contextual paradigm and surrounding environment is a challenge. This special issue on \\u201cArtificial Intelligence In Education\\u201d is focused on drawing original studies related to the development and refinement of smart agents that can be applied across the educational domain.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"2d891ff211a0e9a7509613124e00290a7c2ba520\", \"abstract\": \"The application of artificial intelligence technology in higher education has study value and study space.

It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms. Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias\\u2013variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias\\u2013variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This \\u201cdouble-descent\\u201d curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias\\u2013variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"0e4a356b5114d7fc4303495002c9b52a631b608e\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"6e23398447a022fb9495c44fa80e9de593a574bc\", \"abstract\": \"Machine learning has emerged with big data technologies and high-performance computing to create new opportunities for data intensive science in the multi-disciplinary agri-technologies domain.

Generally, ML tools learn from data to find insights or make fast predictions of target properties. Recently, ML is also greatly influencing heterogeneous catalysis research due to the availability of ML (e.g., Python Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and workflow management tools (e.g., ASE, Atomate), the growing amount of data in materials databases (e.g., Novel Materials Discovery Laboratory, Citrination, Materials Project, CatApp), and algorithmic improvements. New catalysts are needed for sustainable chemical production, alternative energy, and pollution mitigation applications to meet the demands of our world\\u2019s rising population. It is a challenging endeavor, however, to make novel heterogeneous catalysts with good performance (i.e., stable, active, selective) because their performance depends on many properties: composition, support, surface termination, particle size, particle morphology, and atomic coordination environment. Additionally, the properties of heterogeneous catalysts can change under reaction conditions through various phenomena such as Ostwald ripening, particle disintegration, surface oxidation, and surface reconstruction. Many heterogeneous catalyst structures are disordered or amorphous in their active state, which further complicates their atomic-level characterization by modeling and experiment. Computational modeling using quantum mechanical (QM) methods such as density functional theory (DFT) can accelerate catalyst screening by enabling rapid prototyping and revealing active sites and structure-activity relations. The high computational cost of QM methods, however, limits the range of catalyst spaces that can be examined. Recent progress in merging ML with QM modeling and experiments promises to drive forward rational catalyst design. Therefore, it is timely to highlight the ability of ML tools to accelerate heterogeneous catalyst research. A key question we aim to address in this perspective is how machine learning can aid heterogeneous catalyst design and discovery. ML has been used in catalysis research since at least the 1990s. Early studies used neural networks to correlate catalyst physicochemical properties and reaction conditions with measured catalytic performance, but these studies were limited in the number of systems considered. Recently, ML has been applied to the high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and found to be predictive and applicable across a broad space of catalysts. ML algorithms such as decision trees, kernel ridge regression, neural networks, support vector machines, principal component analysis, and compressed sensing can help create predictive models of catalyst target properties, which are typically figures of merit corresponding to stability, activity, selectivity. In this perspective, we discuss various areas where ML is making an impact on heterogeneous catalysis research. ML is also aiding homogeneous catalysis research and shares many similarities (and differences) with ML for heterogeneous catalysis, but this discussion is beyond the perspective\\u2019s scope (for interested readers, see Ref. 26\\u201328). Here, we emphasize the ability of ML combined with QM calculations to speed-up the search for optimal catalysts in combinatorial large spaces, such as alloys. ML-derived interatomic potentials for accurate and fast catalyst simulations will also be assessed, as well as the opportunity for ML to help find descriptors of catalyst performance in large datasets.

A modern machine learning method can be often reduced to a mathematical optimization problem. Among algorithms to solve the optimization problem, gradient descent and its variants like stochastic gradient descent and momentum methods are the most popular ones. The optimization problem induced from classical machine learning methods is often a convex and smooth one, for which gradient descent is guaranteed to solve it efficiently. On the other hand,modern machine learning methods, like deep neural networks, often require solving a non-smooth and non-convex problem. Theoretically, non-convex mathematicaloptimization problems cannot be solved efficiently. However, in practice, gradient descent and its variants can find a global optimum efficiently. These competing factsshow that often there are special structures in the optimization problems that can make gradient descent succeed in practice. This thesis presents technical contributions to fill the gap between theory andpractice on the gradient descent algorithm. The outline of the thesis is as follows. In the first part, we consider applying gradient descent to minimize the empiricalrisk of a neural network. We will show if a multi-layer neural network with smooth activation function is sufficiently wide, then randomly initialized gradient descent can efficiently find a global minimum of the empirical risk. We will also show the same result for the two-layer neural network with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. It is quite surprising that although the objective function of neural networks is non-convex, gradient descent can still find their global minimum. Lastly, we will study structural property of the trajectory induced by the gradient descent algorithm.? In the second part, we assume the label is generated from a two-layer teacher convolutional neural network and we consider using gradient descent to recover the teacher convolutional neural network. We will show that if the input distribution is Gaussian, then gradient descent can recovered a one-hidden-layer convolutional neural network in which both the convolutional weights and the output wights are unknown parameters to be recovered. We will also show that the Gaussian input assumption can be relaxed to a general structural assumption if we only need to recover a single convolutional filter. In the third part, we study conditions under which gradient descent fails. Wewill show gradient descent can take exponential time to optimize a smooth function with the strict saddle point property for which the noise-injected gradient can optimize in polynomial time. While our focus is theoretical, whenever possible, we also present experiments that illustrate our theoretical findings.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"bdefcfdcc33440ef992dbe192c0c0350ba9bbb1a\", \"abstract\": \"1 August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain 2 University Pompeu Fabra, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Barcelona, Spain 3 University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Department of Cardiovascular Diseases, Zagreb, Croatia 4 Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Brussels, Belgium 5 Computer Science Department, Intelligent Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (IDEAI) Research Center, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain 6 Wales Heart Research Institute, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK 7 ICREA, Barcelona, Spain\"}, {\"paperId\": \"29d1d2adf899a53f1c5a6602f3b756422c710001\", \"abstract\": \"Industry 4.0 is the new industrial stage that is committed to greater automation, connectivity and globalization.

To bridge the gap between what is possible and what is practiced, we researched approaches to developing an artificial intelligence (AI) application that can provide real-time patient-specific decision support.\\n\\n\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\\nThe Oncology Expert Advisor (OEA) was designed to simulate peer-to-peer consultation with three core functions: patient history summarization, treatment options recommendation, and management advisory. Machine-learning algorithms were trained to construct a dynamic summary of patients cancer history and to suggest approved therapy or investigative trial options. All patient data used were retrospectively accrued. Ground truth was established for approximately 1,000 unique patients. The full Medline database of more than 23 million published abstracts was used as the literature corpus.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nOEA's accuracies of searching disparate sources within electronic medical records to extract complex clinical concepts from unstructured text documents varied, with F1 scores of 90%-96% for non-time-dependent concepts (e.g., diagnosis) and F1 scores of 63%-65% for time-dependent concepts (e.g., therapy history timeline). Based on constructed patient profiles, OEA suggests approved therapy options linked to supporting evidence (99.9% recall; 88% precision), and screens for eligible clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (97.9% recall; 96.9% precision).\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nOur results demonstrated technical feasibility of an AI-powered application to construct longitudinal patient profiles in context and to suggest evidence-based treatment and trial options.

By constructing dynamic patient profiles from disparate data sources and organizing and vetting vast literature for relevance to a specific patient, such AI applications could empower oncologists to consider all therapy options based on the latest scientific evidence for their patients, and help them spend less time on information \\\"hunting and gathering\\\" and more time with the patients.

It has been accepted that pain is a complex phenomenon. Contemporary methods of computational science can use complex clinical and experimental data to better understand the complexity of pain. Among data science techniques, machine learning is referred to as a set of methods (Fig. 1) that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict or classify future data, to observe structures such as subgroups in the data, or to extract information from the data suitable to derive new knowledge. Together with (bio)statistics, artificial intelligence and machine learning aim at learning from data. Although statistics can be regarded as a branch of mathematics, artificial intelligence and machine learning have developed from computer science (Ref. 58; see also https://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). The initial definition of artificial intelligence originates from Alan Turing who proposed an experiment where 2 players, who can either be human or artificial, try to convince a human third player, that they are also humans. The test of artificial intelligence is passed if the third player cannot tell who is the machine. Important steps in the development of machine learning were the first creation of the computer learning program, which was a checker game, and the first neural network called the perceptron. Statistics uses mathematical equations to model probability relationships between data variables, whereas machine learning learns from data without the necessity of previous knowledge. It aims at optimization and performance of an algorithm rather than on the analysis of the probabilities of observations, given a known underlying data distribution. Nevertheless, both machine learning and statistics techniques are working in concert for pattern recognition, knowledge discovery, and data mining and share partly the same methods such as regression, which is used widely in statistics but is also considered as a classification method in machine learning (Fig. 1). In the present research context, when provided with painrelated data, machine-learned methods are able to learn a mapping of complex features to a known class, that is, to predict a pain phenotype class from a complex pattern of acquired parameters. After the machine has learned the prediction of a pain-related phenotype, the algorithm can subsequently be used on new data from which the class membership of a novel yet unclassified subject can be identified. However, machine learning methods can also be used for pattern recognition in complex pain-related data to reveal traces of an underlying molecular background or for knowledge discovery in big data in a drug discovery or repurposing context. The increasing use of contemporary methods of computational science is reflected in the rising number of reports using machine learning for pain research (Table 1). This review is focused on machine-learned technologies applied to general pain research that allow one to analyze and predict pain phenotypes and to obtain knowledge from experimental and clinical pain-related data.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"b4999584fc04fb72f7af0efb87948565452fd816\", \"abstract\": \"The twenty-five papers in this special cluster issue focus on machine learning applications in electromagnetics.

This column presents basic information about AI and identifies opportunities with AI and associated risks. AI is the science of using computers to mimic human abilities (Nevala, 2017): speech, sensory abilities, movement, and so much more. Machine learning is a subset of AI; the computer uses a large training set of data to look for relationships and later applies the relationships to a new set of data to make predicted outcomes (Nevala, 2017). AI and machine learning were first discussed in research literature in the 1970s; however, because of limitations in computing power, few tangible advances in technology occurred until recently (Kulikowski, 2019). Now, AI is embedded in the human experience without our realizing it. For example, most email and texting applications suggest word choices, mimicking the speech patterns of their human users. Online shopping sites now suggest buying itemsbased on past purchases. These advanced technologies work in the background and have the potential to change human society in the future (Anderson, Rainie, & Luchsinger, 2018). But what does this mean for health care and nursing? In health care, the promise of AI includes the discovery of disease etiologies; the ability to select a treatment option for patients based on predicted outcomes; and calculation of disease risk based on genetic, environmental, and social factors (Galimova, Buzaev, Ramilevich, Yuldybaev, & Shaykhulova, 2019). The reality is more complicated. In order to use the vast amount of data created from personal and medical devices, the complexity of aligning of data must be addressed because data are different in terms of what the Vendome Group (2015) calls the 6Vs: volume (amount of data), variety (different structures of data), veracity (the trustworthiness of the data), velocity (frequency of data coming into the system), visualization (presentation of outcomes in an actionable manner), and value (usefulness in improving health care outcomes).

Third, there is an interest in automating not only the model building process itself (cf. the Automated Statistician) but also in automating the preprocessing steps (data wrangling). \\n \\nThis Dagstuhl seminar brought together researchers from all areas concerned with data science in order to study whether, to what extent, and how data science can be automated.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"fbd31ec3b48765ce1f05265af08d5e85bb243c92\", \"abstract\": \"The name \\u2018machine learning\\u2019 was coined in 1959 [1], while the most widely quoted formal definition\\u2014\\u2018A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks inT, as measured by P, improves with experience E\\u2019\\u2014was given in the first textbook about machine learning by T. Mitchell in 1997 [2]. Roughly speaking, machine learning aims to enable computers to improve performance by experience. As experience usually appear as data examples, the main focus of machine learning is actually about the study and construction of learning algorithms that are able to build predictive or descriptive models from data. With the increasing demand of computerized data analysis, machine learning becomes more and more important, and stirs up the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom. To reflect the state-of-the-art research progress in the field of machine learning in China and beyond, this special section of the National Science Review presents several timely technical reviews and perspectives, along with a research highlight and an interview. In \\u2018Learning representations on graphs\\u2019, Zhu highlights recent effort about learning with network data that are typically represented as graphs. In the perspective \\u2018Model-driven deep learning\\u2019, Xu and Sun present their recent study about trying to design neural network topology with theoretical foundations, and make the network structure explainable and predictable. In the perspective \\u2018Deep learning for natural language processing\\u2019, Li summarizes the five major tasks in natural language processing, and discusses the advantages and challenges of deep learning. Causality plays an important role in explanation, prediction, decision making, etc., and it is desirable to learn causal knowledge from data. In the third perspective, Zhang et al. summarize their recent progress along this direction. Zhang and Yang offer an overview of multi-task learning, which aims to improve the performance of multiple related learning tasks by leveraging useful information among them. Due to the high cost of data-labeling process, in many tasks, it is desirable to do weakly supervised learning. Zhou provides an introduction to this direction. The special topic ends with an interview with T. Dietterich, the former president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) (the most prestigious association in thefieldofAI) and the foundingpresident of the International Machine Learning Society, about exciting recent advances and technical challenges ofmachine learning, aswell as its big impact on the world.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"7b543533a0092a5bf6c7c01c9d58ea338db5bfd2\", \"abstract\": \"Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence.

The intent of this white paper is to provide a high-level introduction to problems in accelerator science and operation where incorporating ML-based approaches may provide significant benefit.

Data science, derives information from data using many methods, computer tools, and algorithms to acquire, store, transmit, clean, transform, and analyze data (2, 3). Prediction research develops predictive models, validates their performance, and studies their clinical impact (4). Machine learning (ML), a growing discipline, offers a new paradigm for accelerating medical research (5, 6). ML algorithms are computer programs designed to automatically improve (learn) from experience with more data. ML is a natural extension of statistics and encompasses a spectrum of related algorithms\\u2014from logistic regression (LR) to deep neural networks (7). The fewer assumptions, the more complex, and automated are the models. Moving from human \\u201cexpert\\u201d knowledge or a simplifying mathematical formulation (e.g., linear or Gaussian forms) guiding \\u201cfeature\\u201d development and model structure to ensembles of modules that derive representations from that data yields greater algorithmic automation\\u2014and less human intervention\\u2014offering accelerated medical research and improved individual outcomes. Many think the best is yet to come. Others warn of a big data hype cycle at the point of inflated expectations, often followed by a chasm of disillusionment before the value of data science can be known (8). To avoid this chasm of disillusionment early, adopters have a responsibility to be conscientious and meticulous about the description of these new, paradigm shifting techniques. This requires clarity about what is being done and why, understandable, transparent method descriptions without hype. Prediction research promises much as an adjunct to clinical practice. Understanding ML will require clinicians to learn new data analytic techniques and new model assessment methods. Before accepting ML research as useful or generalizable, evaluation requires the same careful attention to objectives, methods, results, and interpretation as for any article. Kamaleswaran et al (9), published in this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, are to be congratulated for joining the zeitgeist and attempting to apply ML to ICU data. We will be worthy of congratulation when we are able to understand and evaluate such publications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been through the disillusionment chasm several times. First defined in 1956, AI meant the ability of machines to mimic human intelligent behavior, which implies generalizable learning and directed action. AI lost credibility in the scientific community due to lack of computational power, lack of data, and hype. To be artificially intelligent, computer systems (think autonomous cars) must rapidly and accurately acquire data about the environment, curate (acquire, clean, transform, store) it, and analyze that data, in a timely fashion, often by ML predictive analytics as a part of an AI system. Subsequently, this analysis must direct action, and ideally the AI system learns from the consequences of these actions by acquiring more data. Clear language is important to understand ML and AI articles. The meaning of the term \\u201cAI\\u201d has been blurred to apply to almost anything that has a part in AI such as ML algorithms trained to specific tasks which, as used in this article (9), are a far cry from mimicking human intelligent behavior. Misleading claims will confuse the reader. In this article (9), AI, as the title states, was not used to identify the physiomarkers which were manually selected. What the authors did was explore the ability of three ML algorithms to identify predetermined sepsis targets. Confusion about what AI is and can do will lead to misunderstanding and disillusionment. ML algorithms, as in the study by Kamaleswaran et al (9) (LR, random forest, and convolutional neural networks [CNNs]), enable software to improve performance (learn) with more data\\u2014but they are data hungry (4, 5, 10). Lack of sufficient data led to disillusionment in the past\\u2014a solvable problem that still hinders us (11). Use of limited populations, with sparse targets, leads to imperfectly trained models without generalizability. Any model with data-derived coefficients, whether simple LR or neural networks, must be evaluated on datasets that are independent of development data. With sufficient sample size, standard practice randomly partitions data into training and test sets. With small sample size, partitioning results in inadequately small test sets with few targets, making conclusions impossible. A properly performed k-fold cross-validation mitigates issues arising from small sample size, but aggregate performance is measured from all k models, not merely the best performing. In classification problems (dichotomous e.g., predicting survival or sepsis), if the test set (or folds of a cross-validation) is too small for any one hypothesis, the performance of empirically derived models will have high uncertainty. For this article (9), the reader must ask, are 20 targets across a fivefold crossvalidation in 496 patients sufficient? *See also p. e495.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"829797080bf78e70a98d626a185b83c4cc5a043e\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract As demand for data scientists in audit/Governance, risk management and compliance (GRC), and industry in general, outpaces supply, data science in a box\\u2014packaged analytics powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and guided machine learning\\u2014can bridge the gap to bring analytics to every major enterprise.

This is even more true with deep learning, which requires little engineering by hand and is responsible for many of Artificial Intelligence's spectacular successes.

Mousavi and Beroza provide a comprehensive review of the deep-learning techniques being applied to seismic datasets, covering approaches, limitations, and opportunities. The trends in data processing and analysis can be instructive for geoscience and other research areas more broadly. \\u2014BG The ways in which deep learning can help process and analyze large seismological datasets are reviewed. BACKGROUND Seismology is the study of seismic waves to understand their origin\\u2014most obviously, sudden fault slip in earthquakes, but also explosions, volcanic eruptions, glaciers, landslides, ocean waves, vehicular traffic, aircraft, trains, wind, air guns, and thunderstorms, for example. Seismology uses those same waves to infer the structure and properties of planetary interiors. Because sources can generate waves at any time, seismic ground motion is recorded continuously, at typical sampling rates of 100 points per second, for three components of motion, and on arrays that can include thousands of sensors. Although seismology is clearly a data-rich science, it often is a data-driven science as well, with new phenomena and unexpected behavior discovered with regularity. And for at least some tasks, the careful and painstaking work of seismic analysts over decades and around the world has also made seismology a data label\\u2013rich science. This facet makes it fertile ground for deep learning, which has entered almost every subfield of seismology and outperforms classical approaches, often dramatically, for many seismological tasks. ADVANCES Seismic wave identification and onset-time, first-break determination for seismic P and S waves within continuous seismic data are foundational to seismology and are particularly well suited to deep learning because of the availability of massive, labeled datasets. It has received particularly close attention, and that has led, for example, to the development of deep learning\\u2013based earthquake catalogs that can feature more than an order of magnitude more events than are present in conventional catalogs. Deep learning has shown the ability to outperform classical approaches for other important seismological tasks as well, including the discrimination of earthquakes from explosions and other sources, separation of seismic signals from background noise, seismic image processing and interpretation, and Earth model inversion. OUTLOOK The development of increasingly cost-effective sensors and emerging ground-motion sensing technologies, such as fiber optic cable and accelerometers in smart devices, portend a continuing acceleration of seismological data volumes, so that deep learning is likely to become essential to seismology\\u2019s future. Deep learning\\u2019s nonlinear mapping ability, sequential data modeling, automatic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and reparameterization are all advantageous for processing high-dimensional seismic data, particularly because those data are noisy and, from the point of view of mathematical inference, incomplete. Deep learning for scientific discovery and direct extraction of insight into seismological processes is clearly just getting started. Aspects of seismology pose interesting additional challenges for deep learning. Many of the most important problems in earthquake seismology\\u2014such as earthquake forecasting, ground motion prediction, and rapid earthquake alerting\\u2014concern large and damaging earthquakes that are (fortunately) rare. That rarity poses a fundamental challenge for the data-hungry methods of deep learning: How can we train reliable models, and how do we validate them well enough to rely on them when data are scarce and opportunities to test models are infrequent? Further, how can we operationalize deep-learning techniques in such a situation, when the mechanisms by which they make predictions from data may not be easily explained, and the consequences of incorrect models are high? Incorporating domain knowledge through physics-based and explainable deep learning and setting up standard benchmarking and evaluation protocols will help ensure progress, as is the nascent emergence of a seismological data science ecosystem. More generally, a combination of data science literacy for geoscientists as well as recruiting data science expertise will help to ensure that deep-learning seismology reaches its full potential. Deep-learning processing of seismic data and incorporation of domain knowledge can lead to new capabilities and new insights across seismology. A.

Machine learning is a vibrant subfield of computer science that draws on models and methods from statistics, algorithms, computational complexity, artificial intelligence, control theory, and a variety of other disciplines. Its primary focus is on computationally and informationally efficient algorithms for inferring good predictive models from large data sets, and thus is a natural candidate for application to problems arising in HFT, both for trade execution and the generation of alpha. The inference of predictive models from historical data is obviously not new in quantitative finance; ubiquitous examples include coefficient estimation for the CAPM, Fama and French factors [5], and related approaches. The special challenges for machine learning presented by HFT generally arise from the very fine granularity of the data \\u2014 often microstructure data at the resolution of individual orders, (partial) executions, hidden liquidity, and cancellations \\u2014 and a lack of understanding of how such low-level data relates to actionable circumstances (such as profitably buying or selling shares, optimally executing a large order, etc.). In the language of machine learning, whereas models such as CAPM and its variants already prescribe what the relevant variables or \\u201cfeatures\\u201d are for prediction or modeling (excess returns, book-to-market ratios, etc.), in many HFT problems one may have no prior intuitions about how (say) the distribution of liquidity in the order book relates to future price movements, if at all. Thus feature selection or feature engineering becomes an important process in machine learning for HFT, and is one of our central themes. Since HFT itself is a relatively recent phenomenon, there are few published works on the application of machine learning to HFT. For this reason, we structure the chapter around a few case studies from our own work [6, 14]. In each case study, we focus on a specific trading problem we would like to solve or optimize; the (microstructure) data from which we hope to solve this problem; the variables or features derived from the data as inputs to a machine learning process; and the machine learning algorithm applied to these features. The cases studies we will examine are:\"}, {\"paperId\": \"d09b67459d6bd6d8c7aae105552ad174883389c0\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"327395582fe9f9d7efca7a962f6b99bbe3f610dc\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"fd0e92b3a6c987bd80edbf3b55a39b5f9a6ffe40\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"b7185125d44803132b7c2434c977dcfa4eff3d13\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"60cf49038406fa732a48404d70f596103faac8f4\", \"abstract\": \"Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning which uses artificial neural networks that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.

The intrinsically high dimensionality of the space of realizable materials makes traditional approaches ineffective for large-scale explorations. Modern data science and machine learning tools developed for increasingly complicated problems are an attractive alternative. An imminent climate catastrophe calls for a clean energy transformation by overhauling current technologies within only several years of possible action available. Tackling this crisis requires the development of new materials at an unprecedented pace and scale. For example, organic photovoltaics have the potential to replace existing silicon-based materials to a large extent and open up new fields of application. In recent years, organic light-emitting diodes have emerged as state-of-the-art technology for digital screens and portable devices and are enabling new applications with flexible displays. Reticular frameworks allow the atom-precise synthesis of nanomaterials and promise to revolutionize the field by the potential to realize multifunctional nanoparticles with applications from gas storage, gas separation, and electrochemical energy storage to nanomedicine. In the recent decade, significant advances in all these fields have been facilitated by the comprehensive application of simulation and machine learning for property prediction, property optimization, and chemical space exploration enabled by considerable advances in computing power and algorithmic efficiency. In this Account, we review the most recent contributions of our group in this thriving field of machine learning for material science. We start with a summary of the most important material classes our group has been involved in, focusing on small molecules as organic electronic materials and crystalline materials.

In this systematic review, we used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, to address issues such as e-sensing with chemometric methods for food quality control (FQC).

CNN, a machine-learning algorithm similar to deep learning, has demonstrated its capability to recognise specific features that can detect pathological lesions. AIM To assess the use of CNNs in examining HCC and liver masses images in the diagnosis of cancer and evaluating the accuracy level of CNNs and their performance. METHODS The databases PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science and research books were systematically searched using related keywords. Studies analysing pathological anatomy, cellular, and radiological images on HCC or liver masses using CNNs were identified according to the study protocol to detect cancer, differentiating cancer from other lesions, or staging the lesion. The data were extracted as per a predefined extraction. The accuracy level and performance of the CNNs in detecting cancer or early stages of cancer were analysed. The primary outcomes of the study were analysing the type of cancer or liver mass and identifying the type of images that showed optimum accuracy in cancer detection. RESULTS A total of 11 studies that met the selection criteria and were consistent with the aims of the study were identified. The studies demonstrated the ability to differentiate liver masses or differentiate HCC from other lesions (n = 6), HCC from cirrhosis or development of new tumours (n = 3), and HCC nuclei grading or segmentation (n = 2). The CNNs showed satisfactory levels of accuracy. The studies aimed at detecting lesions (n = 4), classification (n = 5), and segmentation (n = 2). Several methods were used to assess the accuracy of CNN models used. CONCLUSION The role of CNNs in analysing images and as tools in early detection of HCC or liver masses has been demonstrated in these studies. While a few limitations have been identified in these studies, overall there was an optimal level of accuracy of the CNNs used in segmentation and classification of liver cancers images.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"2067694b1850388ba934270472e0cfdfe28fe566\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"45272c5683128d5482599c9f9872bf0ecc3d0911\", \"abstract\": \"Twitter has withstood the test of time as a successful social networking platform.

Burke et al. reviewed this recent progress with a particular focus on machine-learning approaches and artificial intelligence methods. Drawing on examples mostly from Africa, they conclude that satellite-based methods enhance rather than replace ground-based data collection, and progress depends on a combined approach. Science, this issue p. eabe8628 BACKGROUND Accurate and comprehensive measurements of a range of sustainable development outcomes are fundamental inputs into both research and policy. For instance, good measures are needed to monitor progress toward sustainability goals and evaluate interventions designed to improve development outcomes. Traditional approaches to measurement of many key outcomes rely on household surveys that are conducted infrequently in many parts of the world and are often of low accuracy. The paucity of ground data stands in contrast to the rapidly growing abundance and quality of satellite imagery. Multiple public and private sensors launched in recent years provide temporal, spatial, and spectral information on changes happening on Earth\\u2019s surface. Here we review a rapidly growing scientific literature that seeks to use this satellite imagery to measure and understand various outcomes related to sustainable development. We pay particular attention to recent approaches that use methods from artificial intelligence to extract information from images, as these methods typically outperform earlier approaches and enable new insights. Our focus is on settings and applications where humans themselves, or what they produce, are the outcome of interest and on where these outcomes are being measured using satellite imagery. ADVANCES We describe and synthesize the variety of approaches that have been used to extract information from satellite imagery, with particular attention given to recent machine learning\\u2013based approaches and settings in which training data are limited or noisy. We then quantitatively assess predictive performance of these approaches in the domains of smallholder agriculture, economic livelihoods, population, and informal settlements. We show that satellite-based performance in predicting these outcomes is reasonably strong and improving. Performance improvements have come through a combination of more numerous and accurate training data, more abundant and higher-quality imagery, and creative application of advances in computer vision to satellite inputs and sustainability outcomes. Further, our analyses suggest that reported model performance likely understates true performance in many settings, given the noisy data on which predictions are evaluated and the types of noise typically observed in sustainability applications. For multiple outcomes of interest, satellite-based estimates can now equal or exceed the accuracy of traditional approaches to outcome measurement. We describe multiple methods through which the true performance of satellite-based approaches can be better understood. Integration of satellite-based sustainability measurements into research has been broad, and we describe applications in agriculture, fisheries, health, and economics. Documented uses of these measurements in public-sector decision-making are rarer, which we attribute in part to the novelty of the approaches, their lack of interpretability, and the potential benefits to some policy-makers of not having certain outcomes be measured. OUTLOOK The largest constraint to satellite-based model performance is now training data rather than imagery. While imagery has become abundant, the scarcity and frequent unreliability of ground data make both training and validation of satellite-based models difficult. Expanding the quantity and quality of such data will quickly accelerate progress in this field. Other opportunities for advancement include improvements in model interpretability, fusion of satellites with other nontraditional data that provide complementary information, and more-rigorous evaluation of satellite-based approaches (relative to available alternatives) in the context of specific use cases. Nevertheless, despite the current and future promise of satellite-based approaches, we argue that these approaches will amplify rather than replace existing ground-based data collection efforts in most settings. Many outcomes of interest will likely never be accurately estimated with satellites; for outcomes where satellites do have predictive power, high-quality local training data can nearly always improve model performance. Increasing collection of satellite imagery can help measure livelihood outcomes in areas where ground data are sparse. (Left) Interval between nationally representative economic surveys over the past three decades shows long lags in many developing countries.

(Right) Performance in measuring the presence of informal settlements, crop yields on smallholder agricultural plots, and village-level asset wealth. R2, coefficient of determination. Accurate and comprehensive measurements of a range of sustainable development outcomes are fundamental inputs into both research and policy. We synthesize the growing literature that uses satellite imagery to understand these outcomes, with a focus on approaches that combine imagery with machine learning.

AI/ML techniques revolutionize big data analytics through signals and imaging detection, segmentation, and characterization; data fusion processes of association, estimation, and prediction, and modeling of deformation, structural, and materials awareness. Unfortunately, the dominance of AI/ML applications may hinder fundamental understanding of driving parameters in complicated material properties, including the impact of local chemistry and energy influences on nucleation, phase evolution, and bonding. As mathematical complexities are modeled using AI/ML approaches the interaction of driving mechanisms and underlying physics-based and first-principles understanding is often omitted in the final modeling of material behavior.

As an example, artificial neural networks, currently an essential tool in many applications that require learning from data, were originally inspired by insights from biological neural networks. Since its inception as a field, the progress of artificial intelligence has at times converged and at times diverged from the field of neuroscience. While occasional divergence can be fruitful, in this dissertation we will explore some advantageous synergies between machine learning, cognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, this thesis focuses on vision and images. The human visual system has been widely studied from both behavioural and neuroscientific points of view, as vision is the dominant sense of most people. In turn, machine vision has also been an active area of research, currently dominated by the use of artificial neural networks. Despite their origin and some similarities with biological networks, the recent progress in neural networks for image understanding has shown signs of divergence from neuroscience. One likely cause is the focus on benchmark performance, regardless of what the models learn. This work focuses instead on learning representations that are more aligned with visual perception and the biological vision. For that purpose, I have studied tools and aspects from cognitive science and computational neuroscience, and attempted to incorporate them into machine learning models of vision. A central subject of this dissertation is data augmentation, a commonly used technique for training artificial neural networks to augment the size of data sets through transformations of the images. Although often overlooked, data augmentation implements transformations that are perceptually plausible, since they correspond to the transformations we see in our visual world\\u2014 changes in viewpoint or illumination, for instance. Furthermore, neuroscientists have found that the brain invariantly represents objects under these transformations. Throughout this dissertation, I use these insights to analyse data augmentation as a particularly useful inductive bias, a more effective regularisation method for artificial neural networks, and as the framework to analyse and improve the invariance of vision models to perceptually plausible transformations. Overall, this work aims to shed more light on the properties of data augmentation and demonstrate the potential of interdisciplinary research.

This approach contrasts with previous machine learning research on this problem, which has mainly concentrated on predicting the toxicity of unknown chemicals. Our contribution to the field of data mining is the ability to discover useful frequent patterns that are beyond the complexity of association rules or their known variants. This is vital to the problem, which requires the discovery of patterns that are out of the reach of simple transformations to frequent itemsets.

This means that it is often performed on data collected and stored for a different purpose than analysis; usually for administrative purposes.

In doing so we could compare data mining algorithms to data analysis techniques more commonly used in economics, and see if they allow us to answer different questions, or to answer existing questions in a better way.

Accordingly, data mining is the purposeful use of information technology to implement algorithms from machine learning, statistics, and artificial intelligence to analyze large data sets for the purpose of decision support. The field of data mining grew out of limitations in standard data analysis techniques (Tan et al., 2006). Advancements in machine learning, pattern recognition, and artificial intelligence algorithms coupled with computing trends (CPU power, massive storage devices, high-speed connectivity, and software academic initiatives from companies like Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM) enabled universities to bring data mining courses into their curricula (Jafar, Anderson, & Abdullat, 2008b). Accordingly, Computer Science and Information Systems programs have been aggressively introducing data mining courses into their curricula (Goharian, Grossman, & Raju, 2004; Jafar, Anderson, & Abdullat 2008a; Lenox & Cuff, 2002; Saquer, 2007). Computer Science programs focus on the deep understanding of the mathematical aspects of data mining algorithms and their efficient implementation. They require advanced programming and data structures as prerequisites for their courses (Goharian et al., 2004; Musicant, 2006; Rahal, 2008). Information Systems programs on the other hand, focus on the data analysis and business intelligence aspects of data mining. Students learn the theory of data mining algorithms and their applications. Then they use tools that implement the algorithms to build mining models to analyze data for the purpose of decision support. Accordingly, a first course in programming, a database management course, and a statistical data analysis course suffice as prerequisites. For Information Systems programs, a data centric, algorithm understanding and process-automation approach to data mining similar to Jafar et al. (2008a) and Campos et al. (2005) is more appropriate. A data mining course in an Information Systems program has an (1) analytical component, (2) a tools-based, hands-on component ,and (3) a rich collection of data sets. (1) The analytical component covers the theory and practice of the lifecycle of a data mining analysis project, elementary data analysis, market basket analysis, classification and prediction (decision trees, neural networks, naive Bayes, logistic regression, etc.), cluster analysis and category detection, testing and validation of mining models, and finally the application of mining models for decision support and prediction. Textbooks from Han and Kamber (2006) and Tan et al. (2006) provide a comprehensive coverage of the terminology, theory, and algorithms of data mining. (2) The hands-on component requires the use of tools to build projects based on the algorithms learned in the analytical component. We chose Microsoft Excel with its data mining add-in(s) as the front-end and Microsoft's Cloud Computing and SQL Server 2008 data mining computing engines as the back-end. Microsoft Excel is ubiquitous. It is a natural front-end for elementary data analysis and presentation of data. Its data mining add-in(s) are available as a free download. The add-in(s) are automatically configured to send data to Microsoft's Cloud Computing engine server. The server performs the necessary analysis and receives analysis results back into Excel to present them in tabulated and chart formats. Using wizards, the add-in(s) are easily configured to connect to a SQL Server 2008 running analysis services to send data and receive analysis results back into Excel for presentation. The add-in(s) provide a rich wizard-based, uniform graphical user interface to manage the data, the data mining models, the configurations, and the pre and post view of data and mining models. \\u2026\"}, {\"paperId\": \"3606d46c590c7ace6f161b4c7cec51be9a35e55f\", \"abstract\": \"The novel research area of functional genomics investigates biochemical, cellular, or physiological properties of gene products with the goal of understanding the relationship between the genome and the phenotype.

By leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, now it is possible to develop PBPK models for hundreds of chemicals efficiently, to create in silico models to predict toxicity for a large number of chemicals with similar accuracies compared to in vivo animal experiments, and to analyze a large amount of different types of data (toxicogenomics, high-content image data, etc.) to generate new insights into toxicity mechanisms rapidly, which was impossible by manual approaches in the past. To continue advancing the field of toxicological sciences, several challenges should be considered: (1) not all machine learning models are equally useful for a particular type of toxicology data, and thus it is important to test different methods to determine the optimal approach; (2) current toxicity prediction is mainly on bioactivity classification (yes/no), so additional studies are needed to predict the intensity of effect or dose-response relationship; (3) as more data become available, it is crucial to perform rigorous data quality check and develop infrastructure to store, share, analyze, evaluate, and manage big data; and (4) it is important to convert machine learning models to user-friendly interfaces to facilitate their applications by both computational and bench scientists.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"5bb7daf0c83bb781cb755dc0212fa56d98c3b589\", \"abstract\": \"Increasingly, groups external to educational systems are offering time, expertise and products, creating an intricate web of educational governance where entities outside of formal education contribute to state-funded education systems.

These techniques have garnered strong interest for the analysis of the large, multi-domain open science datasets that are increasingly available in health research. Discovery science in large datasets is challenging given the unconstrained nature of the learning environment where there may be a large number of potential predictors and appropriate ranges for model hyperparameters are unknown. As well, it is likely that explainability is at a premium in order to engage in future hypothesis generation or analysis. Here, we present a novel method that addresses these challenges by exploiting evolutionary algorithms to optimize machine learning discovery science while exploring a large solution space and minimizing bias. We demonstrate that our approach, called integrated evolutionary learning (IEL), provides an automated, adaptive method for jointly learning features and hyperparameters while furnishing explainable models where the original features used to make predictions may be obtained even with artificial neural networks. In IEL the machine learning algorithm of choice is nested inside an evolutionary algorithm which selects features and hyperparameters over generations on the basis of an information function to converge on an optimal solution. We apply IEL to three gold standard machine learning algorithms in challenging, heterogenous biobehavioral data: deep learning with artificial neural networks, decision tree-based techniques and baseline linear models. Using our novel IEL approach, artificial neural networks achieved \\u2265 95% accuracy, sensitivity and specificity and 45\\u201373% R2 in classification and substantial gains over default settings. IEL may be applied to a wide range of less- or unconstrained discovery science problems where the practitioner wishes to jointly learn features and hyperparameters in an adaptive, principled manner within the same algorithmic process. This approach offers significant flexibility, enlarges the solution space and mitigates bias that may arise from manual or semi-manual hyperparameter tuning and feature selection and presents the opportunity to select the inner machine learning algorithm based on the results of optimized learning for the problem at hand.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"e2a01f5318b1313778726c2417b44816515ce64f\", \"abstract\": \"\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate how artificial intelligence (AI), as well as machine learning (ML) techniques, are being applied and implemented within supply chains (SC) and to develop future research directions from thereof.\\n\\n\\nDesign/methodology/approach\\nUsing a systematic literature review methodology, this study analyzes the publications available on Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar that linked both AI and supply chain from one side and ML and supply chain from another side.

Dementia, with Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD) as the leading cause, is expected to rise in tandem. AD accounts for 60%\\u201380% of all dementia cases, with an estimated 5\\u20137 million new cases diagnosed each year. Despite intensive research, the diagnosis of AD is currently made through a combination of clinical assessment, neuroimaging and detection of biomarkers from positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid examination, with patients facing issues including high costs, invasiveness of the procedures. Hence, alternative identification of AD without the use of costly or invasive tests remains a challenge that is difficult to surmount. To date, the healthcare has experienced a significant shift towards early accurate detection as well as early prevention. This importance is highlighted by the screening and surveillance of prevalent diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, breast cancer and dementia. While some of these programmes have been very successful in significantly reducing morbidity and mortality, significant amount of manpower, time and training is required for their successful execution. 10 This has lent greater weight to the adoption of healthcare technology in order to optimise the accuracy and efficiency of such programmes. Artificial intelligence (AI), through the combination of digitised big data and computational power, has emerged at the forefront of healthcare. It appears to be wellsuited to address the needs of the healthcare system: fast and accurate predictive, diagnostic and possibly therapeutic algorithms. Machine learning is able to process large amounts of digitised datasets beyond the limits of human capability, and analyse and convert these data into useful clinical insights for the physician. It is a natural fit for conditions or medical specialties that have a large reserve of labelled digitised datasets. At present, convoluted neural networks (CNN), designed to receive two or threedimensional shaped inputs, is one of the most commonly applied deep learning models in medical imaging analysis. Through the utilisation of CNN deep learning, several landmark studies extracting data from retinal images have shown a high degree of accuracy compared with human graders. 13 In order to achieve this, AI generally still requires large, welllabelled and highquality datasets. This places significant barriers to the development of successful image analysis models. The retina is one of the few select organs where image collection is easily accessible and abundant through the use of ocular imaging technologies. As the microvascular properties and neuronal structures of the retina, such as ganglion cellinner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL), 15 resemble the intracranial neuronal structure and vasculature, it provides a direct visualisation of potential intracranial changes. This combination of unique attributes can potentially provide a low cost, noninvasive analysis of the brain without the patient having to undergo costly neuroimaging to reach a diagnosis. This has attracted increasing research interest, especially in the field of AD where accurate early detection and diagnostic models still remain elusive. The pathogenesis associating retinal changes with AD is currently still unclear. While some evidence suggest the presence of amyloid beta plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles in the retina of patients with AD, 20 the significance remains debatable. On the other hand, recent studies examining structural changes of the retina in patients with AD have indicated extensive changes including loss of macula volume, 23 thinning of the GCIPL 25 and RNFL thickness, and subfoveal choroidal thickness. In the peripheral retina, notable changes include increased drusen formation and reduced retinal vascularity. Optical coherence tomography angiogram (OCTA), which allows for noninvasive assessment of retinal vascularity, has also shown decreased vessel density, perfusion density and increased foveal avascular zone in patients with AD. 29 It is thus apparent that retinal changes, especially retinal thinning and reduction in vascularity, could potentially indicate the development of AD. In the article by Wisely et al the authors have trained an AI model with multiple imaging modalities using CNN deeplearning with the best performing models achieving an area under curve (AUC) between 0.830 and 0.841. A total of 284 eyes from 159 subjects, of which 36 were clinically diagnosed with AD by experienced neurologists, were analysed in this study. Patient data, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCTA quantitative data, ultrawide field retinal photography as well as retinal autofluorescence images were used in the training, validation and testing of the models. Used in isolation, the GCIPL thickness as an indicator of AD had the highest predictive value with an AUC of 0.809. When used in combination, the model that was trained with a combination of GCIPL, OCTA quantitative data and patient data had the highest AUC of 0.841. This paper represents the first attempt as well as a proof of concept at developing a CNN to detect AD using multimodal retinal images. The relatively high predictive ability of the different combination models not only serves as an important foundation for future deep learning models in predicting AD, but also proves the validity of this approach. By testing a varied combination of different imaging modalities available in an ophthalmic clinic, Wisely et al are able to determine the datasets that will provide the greatest yield in accurate prediction of AD. This could contribute to the future development of a robust screening or predictive platform that uses parameters that are costeffective and simple in acquisition.

Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), in particular, are the main cause of death worldwide, accounting for 30% of all fatalities in the United States and 45% in Europe. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are playing an important role in the advancement of heart failure therapy. The main objective of this study was to perform a network meta-analysis of patients with heart failure, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes by comparing the ML and DL models. A comprehensive search of five electronic databases was performed using ScienceDirect, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. The search strategy was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. The methodological quality of studies was assessed by following the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) guidelines. The random-effects network meta-analysis forest plot with categorical data was used, as were subgroups testing for all four types of treatments and calculating odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled network forest, funnel plots, and the league table, which show the best algorithms for each outcome, were analyzed. Seventeen studies, with a total of 285,213 patients with CVDs, were included in the network meta-analysis. The statistical evidence indicated that the DL algorithms performed well in the prediction of heart failure with AUC of 0.843 and CI [0.840\\u20130.845], while in the ML algorithm, the gradient boosting machine (GBM) achieved an average accuracy of 91.10% in predicting heart failure. An artificial neural network (ANN) performed well in the prediction of diabetes with an OR and CI of 0.0905 [0.0489; 0.1673]. Support vector machine (SVM) performed better for the prediction of stroke with OR and CI of 25.0801 [11.4824; 54.7803]. Random forest (RF) results performed well in the prediction of hypertension with OR and CI of 10.8527 [4.7434; 24.8305]. The findings of this work suggest that the DL models can effectively advance the prediction of and knowledge about heart failure, but there is a lack of literature regarding DL methods in the field of CVDs. As a result, more DL models should be applied in this field. To confirm our findings, more meta-analysis (e.g., Bayesian network) and thorough research with a larger number of patients are encouraged.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"979468ea28b6aade5f9e1aa2a980c2fd08bef72d\", \"abstract\": \"The global soil carbon pool has been estimated to exceed the amount of carbon stored in the atmosphere and vegetation, though uncertainties to quantify below-ground carbon and soil carbon fluxes accurately still exist. Modeling soil carbon using artificial intelligence (AI) - machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms - has emerged as a powerful force in the carbon science community. These AI soil carbon models have shown improved performance to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, soil respiration (Rs), and other properties of the global carbon cycle when compared to other modeling approaches. AI systems have advanced abilities to optimize fits between inputs (geospatial environmental covariates) and outputs (e.g., SOC or Rs) through advanced pattern recognition, learning algorithms, latent variables, hyperparameters, hyperplanes, weighting factors, or multiple stacked processing (e.g., convolution and pooling).

The purpose of this review paper is to explore the emergence, applications, and progress of AI-ML and AI-DL algorithms to model soil carbon storage and Rs at regional and global scales.

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to tackle these complex time-dependent interactions and aid researchers in developing models and making pre- dictions, sometimes with better accuracy than traditional modeling that focuses on one or two parameters at a time. Conventional practices of acquiring new experimental data in nuclear materials research are often slow and expensive, limiting the opportunity for data-centric ML, but new methods are changing that paradigm.

Despite this unprecedented success, the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data have become a major concern for all the stakeholders. Data breach reports reveal that the healthcare data industry is one of the key targets of cyber invaders. In fact the last few years have registered an unprecedented rise in healthcare data breaches. Hacking incidents and privilege abuse are the most common threats and have exposed sensitive and protected health data. Experts and researchers are working on various techniques, tools, and methods to address the security issues related to healthcare data. In this article, the main focus is on evaluating the impact of research studies done in the context of healthcare data breach reports to identify the contemporary privacy and confidentiality issues of sensitive healthcare data. Analysis of the research studies depicts that there is a need for proactive security mechanisms that will help the healthcare organizations to identify abnormal user behavior while accessing healthcare data. Moreover, studies also suggest that ML techniques would be highly effective in securing the privacy and confidentiality of the healthcare data. Working further on this premise, the present study also proposes a conceptual framework that will secure the privacy and confidentiality of healthcare data proactively. The proposed framework is based on ML techniques to detect deviated user access against Electronic Health Records.

The new reforms and advanced technologies of artificial intelligence have enabled data analysts to transmute raw data generated by these sectors into meaningful insights for an effective decision-making process. Health care is one of the integral sectors where a large amount of data is generated daily, and making effective decisions based on these data is therefore a challenge. In this study, cases related to childbirth either by the traditional method of vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery were investigated. Cesarean delivery is performed to save both the mother and the fetus when complications related to vaginal birth arise. Objective The aim of this study was to develop reliable prediction models for a maternity care decision support system to predict the mode of delivery before childbirth. Methods This study was conducted in 2 parts for identifying the mode of childbirth: first, the existing data set was enriched and second, previous medical records about the mode of delivery were investigated using machine learning algorithms and by extracting meaningful insights from unseen cases. Several prediction models were trained to achieve this objective, such as decision tree, random forest, AdaBoostM1, bagging, and k-nearest neighbor, based on original and enriched data sets. Results The prediction models based on enriched data performed well in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure, and receiver operating characteristic curves in the outcomes. Specifically, the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor was 84.38%, that of bagging was 83.75%, that of random forest was 83.13%, that of decision tree was 81.25%, and that of AdaBoostM1 was 80.63%. Enrichment of the data set had a good impact on improving the accuracy of the prediction process, which supports maternity care practitioners in making decisions in critical cases. Conclusions Our study shows that enriching the data set improves the accuracy of the prediction process, thereby supporting maternity care practitioners in making informed decisions in critical cases. The enriched data set used in this study yields good results, but this data set can become even better if the records are increased with real clinical data.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"275b695c764f697c5311e8c9ba8aafab60258f0f\", \"abstract\": \"The unparalleled success of artificial intelligence (AI) in the technology sector has catalyzed an enormous amount of research in the scientific community.

Despite astonishing accomplishments, modern machine learning algorithms are still hardly more than adaptive systems. Deep neural networks, for example, represent complexity through complex connectivity but are not able to allow for abstraction and differentiation of interpretable knowledge, i.e., for key mechanisms of human cognition. Like support vector machines, random forests and other statistically motivated algorithms, they do neither reflect nor yield structures and strategies of human thinking. Therefore, we suggest to realign the use of existing machine learning tools with respect to the philosophical paradigm of constructivism, which currently is the key concept in human learning and professional teaching. Based on the idea that learning units like classifiers can be considered models with limited validity, we formulate five principles to guide a constructivist machine learning. We describe how to define such models and model limitations, how to relate them and how relationships allow to abstract and differentiate models. To this end, we propose the use of meta data for classifiers and other models. Moreover, we argue that such meta data-based machine learning results in a knowledge base that is both created by the means of automation and interpretable for humans. Over the last decade, it has become widely accepted to address computational systems intelligent. Not only journalists, but also scientists have adapted this habit in their publications. In fact, many classical engineering tasks like monitoring or regulating have profited from the employment of machine learning (Abellan-Nebot and Romero Subir\\u00f3n 2010; Mohanraj, Jayaraj, and Muraleedharan 2012). The same holds true for pattern recognition, most prominently in automated image and video analysis (Zafeiriou, Zhang, and Zhang 2015; Yang et al. 2011). And even though ultimate challenges like the infamous Turing test are left unsatisfied (You 2015), some exceptional results in specialized tasks like playing the game of go (Silver et al. 2016) make current learning machines look intelligent on a human level.

Clark (Eds.), Proceedings of the AAAI 2019 Spring Symposium on Combining Machine Learning with Knowledge Engineering (AAAI-MAKE 2019). Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA, March 25-27, 2019. A final frontier for learning systems, however, is the variety of alternative cognitive functions observable in a diverse set of individuals or from ambiguous stimuli (Kornmeier and Bach 2012). While philosophy has acknowledged and embraced the subjectivity and limitations of human cognition during the last decades (Prawat and Floden 1994), current learning systems regard cognition a complex, yet technical task to be solved. In particular, established algorithms do neither provide convincing answers to the challenges provided by an ambiguous environment; nor do they offer concepts that explicitly allow for contradictory judgements comparable to differences in social perception. The main reason for this shortcoming is that so far both algorithms and researchers have failed to incorporate a constructivist point of view. Constructivism implies not only cognition to be a highly individual phenomenon, but also humans to take an active role in their perception of the world \\u2013 and that there is no such thing as a human-independent reality (Reich 2009). Yet algorithms and applications aiming to predict things other than laws of nature are implicitly founded on exactly this outdated asumption. In the following, we introduce axioms that allow machine learning to follow constructivist principles. Key features of this approach are the use of modern tools from empirical sciences, model-oriented learning, the ability to handle ambiguity, the ability to integrate supervised and unsupervised learning into a unified framework, the ability to create an individual knowledge base and the ability to abstract, differentiate or discard learned knowledge automatically. 1. The key component of cognitive functionality is a model. Since the introduction of artificial neural networks as a theoretical concept (McCulloch and Pitts 1943), many mathematicians and computer scientists have considered neurons the key component of learning systems. In education and psychology, however, cognitive functions are often seen as certain skills or abilities acquired and exposed by an individual human and described in terms like the concept of competence, which, e.g., is widely used in the modern European education system (M\\u00e9haut and Winch 2012). Functionalistic psychology explains cognitive functions of humans by the concept of mental models (Rouse and Morris 1986). Initially, mental models have been used to understand motor control, e.g., of hand movements (Veldhuyzen and Stassen 1977). In a more general sense, however, mental models are described as \\u201chypothetical constructs\\u201d (Wickens 2000) that can be ordered hierarchically (Rasmussen 1979) and allow a human to make predictions about his physical and social environment (Oatley 1985). It has also been postulated that such models cannot be of static nature but rather underlay continuous modifications (Oatley 1985). Philosophers, too, consider models an important tool in human knowledge acquisition (Klaus 1967, p. 412) or even the only tool, respectively (Stachowiak 1973, p. 56). While varying and concurring theoretical definitions exist, most model concepts assume an image, an origin of the image and a relationship between them. This definition is, e.g., matched by the idea of mathematical modeling as proposed by Heinrich Hertz and others (Hertz 1894; Hamilton 1982). With the rise of robotics and artificial intelligence, engineers have adapted and extended this idea by postulating the concept of a cybernetic model, which involves a generalized subject and an object of the model (Rose 2009). Cybernetics, however, did neither reflect time-related aspects nor issues involved with individual model subjects. This matter was adressed by Herbert Stachowiak, who was influenced by cybernetics when developing his General Model Theory (Hof 2018). He postulated any model to be limited to specific subjects, specific temporal ranges and specific purposes (Stachowiak 1973, p. 133). Limitations, to this end, are considered a matter of fact rather than a matter of definition. Thus, such models circumvent ambiguity by viewing an otherwise ambiguous model with unknown validity limits as a number of models of limited validity. 2. Learning constitutes from constructing, reconstructing or deconstructing models. Modern education is dominated by the ideas of constructivism and constructivist learning (Fox 2001). At its heart, this approach is based on the assumption that humans acquire knowledge and competences actively and individually through processes called construction, reconstruction and deconstruction (Duffy and Jonassen 1992). Construction is associated with creation, innovation and production and implies searching for variations, combinations or transfers of knowledge (Reich 2004, p. 145). Analogously, reconstruction is associated with application, repetition or imitation and implies searching for order, patterns or models (Reich 2004, p. 145). Deconstruction is in the context of constructivism associated with reconsideration, doubt and modification and implies searching for omissions, additions and defective parts of acquired knowledge (Reich 2004, p. 145). Learning algorithms have been used for half a century to transform sample data into models in a mathematical sense, that is: into generalized mathematical relationships between image and origin. The two major approaches or objectives, known as supervised and unsupervised learning, either do or do not require a given target parameter. Artificial neural networks and their relatives are among the most popular and prominent algorithms for learning with a given target parameter (Singh, Thakur, and Sharma 2016), but statistically motivated approaches like support vector machines (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor 2000) or random forests (Breiman 2001) are also widely used for supervised learning; a specialized field of supervised learning is reinforcement learning, which is popular in robotics (Kober and Peters 2012) and adaptive control (Lewis, Vrabie, and Vamvoudakis 2012). For unsupervised learning, too, biologically inspired approaches like self-organizing maps (Kohonen 2001) as well as statistically motivated approaches like k-means (Jain 2010) are employed. To some extent, machine learning parallels modern education concepts. A construction process in the constructivist sense may be matched by an unsupervised learning, i.e., identifying clusterings or dimensionality reduction, and can, e.g., be implemented with self-organizing maps, kmeans, autoencoders or feature clustering (Schmid 2018). A reconstruction process in the constructivist sense may be matched by a supervised learning, i.e., classification or regression tasks, and can, e.g., be implemented with artificial neural networks or random forests (Schmid 2018). Few researchers, however, have discussed a constructivist approach to machine learning (Drescher 1989; Quartz 1993), and even less how to design a deconstruction process. While domainspecific applications with manual re-engineering options exist (Herbst and Karagiannis 2000), to the best of our knowledge, there is currently only one working implementation of an algorithmic deconstruction process (Schmid 2018). 3. Deconstructing models computationally requires model-based meta data. In order to automate and implement a deconstruction process, successfully learned models must be held available for comparison or re-training.

The scope of this SLR includes an in-depth investigation on most AI trending techniques in cybersecurity and state-of-art solutions. A systematic search was performed on various electronic databases (SCOPUS, Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ACM, and MDPI). Out of the identified records, 80 studies published between 2016 and 2021 were selected, surveyed and carefully assessed. This review has explored deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques used in IoT security, and their effectiveness in detecting attacks. However, several studies have proposed smart intrusion detection systems (IDS) with intelligent architectural frameworks using AI to overcome the existing security and privacy challenges. It is found that support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) are among the most used methods, due to high accuracy detection another reason may be efficient memory. In addition, other methods also provide better performance such as extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural networks (NN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN). This analysis also provides an insight into the AI roadmap to detect threats based on attack categories. Finally, we present recommendations for potential future investigations.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"a194704ff34ae96eb0cb9a57c4afbc5adc4c4e57\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"8db6ebe1490f8a8749dae6ddb788cce93cb90f4b\", \"abstract\": \"Background The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the current applications of objective gait analysis using inertial measurement units, custom algorithms and artificial intelligence algorithms in detecting neurological and musculoskeletal gait altering pathologies from healthy gait patterns. Methods Literature searches were conducted of four electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) to identify studies that assessed the accuracy of these custom gait analysis models with inputs derived from wearable devices. Data was collected according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis statement guidelines. Results A total of 23 eligible studies were identified for inclusion in the present review, including 10 custom algorithms articles and 13 artificial intelligence algorithms articles. Nine studies evaluated patients with Parkinson\\u2019s disease of varying severity and subtypes. Support vector machine was the commonest adopted artificial intelligence algorithm model, followed by random forest and neural networks. Overall classification accuracy was promising for articles that use artificial intelligence algorithms, with nine articles achieving more than 90% accuracy. Conclusions Current applications of artificial intelligence algorithms are reasonably effective discrimination between pathological and non-pathological gait. Of these, machine learning algorithms demonstrate the additional capacity to handle complicated data input, when compared to other custom algorithms. Notably, there has been increasing application of machine learning algorithms for conducting gait analysis.

Improved prognostication of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) will greatly benefit the clinical management of oral cancer patients. This review examines the recent development in the field of deep learning for OSCC prognostication. The search was carried out using five different databases\\u2014PubMed, Scopus, OvidMedline, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). The search was carried time from inception until 15 May 2021. There were 34 studies that have used deep machine learning for the prognostication of OSCC. The majority of these studies used a convolutional neural network (CNN). This review showed that a range of novel imaging modalities such as computed tomography (or enhanced computed tomography) images and spectra data have shown significant applicability to improve OSCC outcomes. The average specificity, sensitivity, area under receiving operating characteristics curve [AUC]), and accuracy for studies that used spectra data were 0.97, 0.99, 0.96, and 96.6%, respectively. Conversely, the corresponding average values for these parameters for computed tomography images were 0.84, 0.81, 0.967, and 81.8%, respectively. Ethical concerns such as privacy and confidentiality, data and model bias, peer disagreement, responsibility gap, patient-clinician relationship, and patient autonomy have limited the widespread adoption of these models in daily clinical practices.

The high level of interest in AI essentially originates from deep learning using multi-layered neural network (NN) architectures. Other AI approaches entering medicinal chemistry include expert systems and (laboratory) robotics. However, deep learning is clearly predominant. Of note, ML already has a long history in chemoinformatics and medicinal chemistry. For more than two decades, ML methods have been extensively applied for compound property predictions. In medicinal chemistry, properties of interest for computational studies include, first and foremost, biological activities of small molecules, but also physiochemical (e.g., solubility) or in vivo properties (such as metabolic stability or toxicity). Predictions of such properties aim to support the key task in the practice of medicinal chemistry: deciding which compound(s) to synthesize next. Over the years, NNs \\u2013 which were popular early on for property predictions \\u2013 were for the most part replaced by other ML methods such as support vector machines, random forests or Bayesian modeling.

In medicinal chemistry, chemical intuition continues to play a major role and black box predictions that cannot be explained in chemical terms work against the acceptance of ML for practical applications.

The documentation, definition and, ultimately, the explanation of how natural processes produce these patterns is referred to implicitly in the more standard definitions of these fields, where physics is construed as the study of matter and energy, chemistry the study of the composition of matter, and biology the study of life. It is the patterns existing in these domains that provide the subject matter for physical, chemical and biological study as well as providing the evidence that deterministic physical, chemical and biological processes exist. Moreover, it is these patterns that give nature its structure and organization. If such patterns did not exist\\u2013if everything on or in the Earth simply graded continuously and insensibly into everything else\\u2013it would not only be impossible to conduct a truly scientific investigation into any aspect of our planet, it would be pointless. Fortunately, humans are rather good at recognizing certain types of patterns. Throughout the evolutionary history of our lineage each of our five senses has been focused on, and honed by, natural selection for the purpose of identifying patterns in our surroundings. Our ancestors used these abilities to find food, shelter from extremes of weather, avoid predators, and care for one another. Of these senses, our visual sense is particularly acute (Isbell, 2011). Human intelligence developed to a higher degree than in any other known species, in part to accomplish the task of integrating the sense information collected by our eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. But even more importantly, this same intelligence allowed us to create tools whereby the performance levels of our bodies, as well as the acuity of our senses, can be enhanced well beyond their natural limits. As a result, our species has been able to survive in habitats no other similar creature could tolerate, double or treble its average lifespan over that of its evolutionary progenitors, and diversify to a point where it is now a force of planet-wide change whose influence and effects are becoming as great as those of any of the forces that have shaped the Earth\\u2019s surface in its geological past (e.g., volcanism, tectonism, erosion, glaciation, sea-level change). All of this has been accomplished, for the most part, using the pattern-recognition senses every human child is born with, augmented by tools the vast bulk of whose invention has taken place over the last 100\\u2013150 years. This is a record of progress to be proud of. Yet, we remain far from having reached the end of the path our scientific and technological forbearers have trod. Despite our innate abilities and technological advances, in many contexts our realized abilities to recognize and identify patterns in nature consistently and accurately are little better than those of our distant ancestors. Take, for example, the seemingly humble and straightforward task of identifying the living constituents of an aliquot of common seawater. In 2014 several colleagues and I published results of a blind test of identification accuracies exhibited by expert zooplankton taxonomists (Culverhouse et al., 2014). Twenty-one taxonomists were provided with the same set of six modern plankton samples (c. 700 specimens in total) and asked to place these samples\\u2019 living constituents into ten categories (e.g., Appendicularia, Chaetognatha, Copepoda, Euphausiacea, Ostracoda). Results reported by these experts were then compared. As Figure 1 shows, the tally count data collected from these expert taxonomists exhibits several interesting patterns, These include expected consistencies among experts who were members of the same laboratory, but also disturbing differences among laboratories. Even expert self consistencies (generally regarded as the mark of true expertise) were discouragingly variable, ranging from 99.7% to 68.2% for tally counts and 99.0% to 0.4% for identifications. While this investigation remains the most comprehensive evaluation of expert-level taxonomic identification performance published to date, its results are consistent with those found in a number of previous studies that address this issue. Based on the empirical evidence published to date, taxonomic experts can be relied upon to deliver results that are 70%-80% accurate in terms of their levels Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning in the Earth Sciences\"}, {\"paperId\": \"49885611fc76df2995e4e9dc1fa388367ac7af9d\", \"abstract\": \"Advances in nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) platforms are allowing researchers to routinely collate large genomewide data sets to address a variety of ecological questions. However, with this big data comes big analytical challenges that are increasingly addressed using machine learning (for a review, see Schrider & Kern, 2018). Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence and represents a conglomeration of methods where predictive accuracy is the primary goal (e.g., Belcaid & Toonen, 2015; Breiman, 2001; Elith et al., 2008; Lucas, 2020). Machine learning assumes that the datagenerating process is unknown and complex and finds the dominant patterns by learning the relationships between inputs and responses (Elith et al., 2008). Broadly, machine learning differs from other statistical approaches in two important ways. The first is that predictive performance drives model formulation rather than model selection or expert opinion, and the second is there is less emphasis on model selection ( Breiman, 2001; Lucas, 2020). For these reasons, machine learning has the reputation for being less interpretable and difficult to apply rigorously (Elith et al., 2008; Lucas, 2020; Molnar, 2018). However, in parallel with the revolution of sequencing techniques, there has also been a revolution in data science in terms of predictive performance and techniques to interpret machine learning models (FountainJones et al., 2019; Lucas, 2020; Molnar, 2018). There are now streamlined R and Python packages that make the robust use of algorithms from support vector machines (SVMs) to neural networks readily achievable (e.g., Abadi et al., 2015; Kuhn & Wickham, 2020, see Text Box 1 for some important machine learning terminology). Moreover, other statistical paradigms such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are being applied sidebyside or within machine learning frameworks to enhance the utility of these approaches (e.g., Carlson, 2020; Raynal et al., 2019). The ability of machine learning algorithms to build powerful predictive models that capture complex nonlinear responses with minimal statistical assumptions has been harnessed by most molecular ecology subdisciplines for decades. For example, machine learning models were developed before the turn of the millennium to classify normal or cancerous tissue based on transcription profiles (Furey et al., 2000). Not long after gradient boosting models (GBMs) were developed (e.g., Hastie et al., 2009), researchers were applying the approach to classify population genetics models based on a suite of summary statistics such as Tajima's \\u03b8\\u03c0 (Lin et al., 2011). In addition, extensions of the popular random forest algorithm have been utilized in ecological genetics to untangle the drivers of climate adaptation (Fitzpatrick & Keller, 2015). Generally, however, advances in computer science and machine learning are slow to filter down to ecologists (Belcaid & Toonen, 2015; Elith & Hastie, 2008; FountainJones et al., 2019), partly through unfamiliarity with these types of approaches but also because of the rapid rate of advance in the data science field. This Special Issue aims to help expand the use of machine learning approaches and to help bring advances in data science to the toolkits of molecular ecologists. This issue comprises 17 papers grouped into four sections covering a diverse variety of molecular ecology subdisciplines. The first section covers how machine learning can be applied to make inferences about population demography. We further group these papers algorithmically with four papers utilizing random forest architecture and the remaining four using neural networks. The second section highlights how machine learning can detect signatures of selection across loci. The third section highlights how these methods can be applied to untangle the complex ecological drivers of genomic change (\\u2018ecological genomics\\u2019) and species community dynamics.

We demonstrated how the algorithm could learn from parent-reported medical diagnoses and other characteristics, and thus identify groups of children with similar comorbidities and disabilities, yet with mixed developmental diagnostic labels. We will present follow-up research in 2018 comparing the composition of these groups to that of groups of children defined solely by diagnostic labels (cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, autism, developmental delay, etc.). As intended, the machine learning-defined groups are far more homogeneous with respect to a host of coexisting medical diagnoses and other health-related conditions than those defined by traditional labels. Cluster analysis is useful both because it can find inherent patterns in large volumes of heterogenous data, and because the discovery of such patterns acts as a data reduction technique. In our work with the NSCH data, we identified homogeneous groupings using seventeen simple indicator (yes/no) variables from data on over 80 000 children. Clustering based on these 17 indicators within a population of children with various underlying developmental diagnoses (cerebral palsy, autism spectrum disorder, etc.) reduced the data to seven highly similar, but non-overlapping, groups. This type of cluster analysis can be applied in the context of a single underlying diagnosis as well (e.g. cerebral palsy). The various clustering algorithms can perform equally well here, helping to make sense of within-group heterogeneity by further subdivision. Given limitations in data collected by the NSCH, however, clinical applicability of our results may be limited. An ideal cluster analysis for classifying children with a given developmental disability (or reclassifying children with any number of different diagnoses) would use as wide a variety of patient-specific data as possible. Examples might include health data abstracted directly from medical records, assessments of mobility (e.g. the Gross Motor Function Classification System), neuropsychological assessments, individual education plans, or anthropomorphic measurements. Cravedi et al. come close to achieving the ideal. They use a variant of cluster analysis known as ascendant hierarchical clustering to find subtypes of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome in children in France, using a wide array of clinical and condition-specific variables in their analysis. Their findings are intuitive, sensible, and potentially highly useful in defining clinically meaningful strata under the Tourette syndrome umbrella and in developing therapeutic approaches for treatment of the condition. We anticipate there will be many such applications of machine learning in developmental medicine in the years to come. We noted previously that machine learning has the potential to positively change the role of physicians in patient care. The work by Cravedi et al. reminds us that the role of researchers is likely to change significantly as well. As machine learning continues to provide new ways to think about children with developmental disabilities and their care providers, the path ahead holds many more changes for all branches of medical science. We have no illusions that every step along this path will be a positive one. But we do believe that the journey overall will lead to a better place.

This is especially relevant in healthcare and life sciences where the heterogeneity in both data sources and user expertise, and the underlying complexity of the domain and applications poses serious challenges.

In particular, knowledge graphs support the computation of semantic similarity between objects, providing an understanding of why certain objects are considered similar or different. This is a basic aspect of explainability and is at the core of many machine learning applications. However, when data covers multiple domains, it may be necessary to integrate different ontologies to cover the full semantic landscape of the underlying data. We propose a methodology for semantic explanations in the biomedical domain that is based on the semantic annotation and integration of heterogenous data into a common semantic landscape that supports semantic similarity assessments.

What makes cancer so important is that the cancer incidence rate is growing worldwide which can have major health, economic, and even social impacts on both patients and the governments. Thereby, the early cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment can play a crucial role at the front line of combating cancer. The onset and progression of cancer can occur under the influence of complicated mechanisms and some alterations in the level of genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolome etc. Consequently, the advent of omics science and its broad research branches (such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and so forth) as revolutionary biological approaches have opened new doors to the comprehensive perception of the cancer landscape. Due to the complexities of the formation and development of cancer, the study of mechanisms underlying cancer has gone beyond just one field of the omics arena. Therefore, making a connection between the resultant data from different branches of omics science and examining them in a multi-omics field can pave the way for facilitating the discovery of novel prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic approaches. As the volume and complexity of data from the omics studies in cancer are increasing dramatically, the use of leading-edge technologies such as machine learning can have a promising role in the assessments of cancer research resultant data.

The volume and rate of this data collection can rapidly outpace researchers\\u2019 abilities to process and analyze them. Recent advances in machine learning enable fast, sophisticated analysis of visual data, but have had limited success in the ocean due to lack of data set standardization, insufficient formatting, and aggregation of existing, expertly curated imagery for use by data scientists. To address this need, we have built FathomNet, a public platform that makes use of existing, expertly curated data. Initial efforts have leveraged MBARI\\u2019s Video Annotation and Reference System and annotated deep sea video database, which has more than 7M annotations, 1M frame grabs, and 5k terms in the knowledgebase, with additional contributions by National Geographic Society (NGS) and NOAA\\u2019s Office of Ocean Exploration and Research.

The Ocean is Earth\\u2019s final frontier Exploration and discovery in the ocean are crucial for sustainable management of this resource, and is vital for fisheries, mineral extraction, pharmaceutical development, and recreation. With the role that the ocean plays in modulating the Earth\\u2019s climate, and the role that its inhabitants play in carbon sequestration, accessing and understanding the life that resides within the ocean is critical. Exploring a space as vast as the ocean1, filled with life that we have yet to describe2 and numerous chemical and physical processes that we are only beginning to understand, using traditional, resource-intensive (e.g., time, person-hours, cost) sampling methodologies are limited in their ability to scale in spatiotemporal resolution and engage diverse communities3. However, with the advent of modern robotics4, low-cost observation platforms, and distributed sensing,5, 6 we are beginning to see a paradigm shift in ocean exploration and discovery. This shift is evidenced in satellite remote sensing of near-surface ocean conditions and in the global ARGO float array, where distributed platforms and open data structures are propelling the chemical and remote sensing communities to new scales of observation7\\u20139. Due to a variety of constraints, large-scale sampling of biological communities or processes below the surface waters of the ocean has largely lagged behind. Three common modalities for observing biology and biological processes in the ocean include acoustics, -omics, and imaging, and each sensing modality has their strengths and weaknesses. Acoustics allow for observations of populationand group-scale dynamics, however individual-scale observations, especially determination of animals down to lower taxonomic groups like species, are challenging tasks. Omics, particularly the promising field of eDNA, allows for identification of biological communities based on their shed DNA in the water column. While eDNA studies provide broad-scale views of biological communities with only a few discrete samples, knowing the spatial source of those DNA, how measurements relate to population sizes, and presence of confounding non-marine biological markers in samples are active areas of research that still need to be addressed. On the other hand, imaging enables the identification of animals to the species level, elucidates community structure and spatial relationships in a variety of habitats, and reveals fine-scale behavior of animal groups. However, processing visual data, particularly data with complex scenes and organisms that require expert classifications, is a resource-intensive process that cannot be scaled without significant advances in automation. Observing life in the ocean using imaging Despite the resource-intensive nature of analysing visual data, underwater imaging continues to be widely used in the marine science and technology communities. Common imaging techniques involve the use of high-definition video cameras, microscopy, macro-scale, stereo, volumetric, and multi-spectral camera systems with illumination provided by single-band or wide-band lights, LEDs, and lasers10, 11. Underwater surveys and counts of animals can be accomplished in a variety of environments due to the ease by which imaging technology can be deployed, and the number of remotely controlled and autonomous platforms that can be used12. Underwater imaging is also being used in real-time for underwater vehicle navigation and control while performing difficult tasks in complex environments. Imaging has also been used as an effective engagement tool to share marine life and the issues facing the ocean with broader communities. These efforts have resulted in quantifiable changes in public opinion, and in building more ocean-aware communities13. The value of imaging to convey understanding of ocean life is without doubt. Given all these applications of underwater imaging, a number of annotation tools have been developed to deal with the challenges associated with managing and analyzing visual data. These efforts have resulted in many capable software solutions that can either be deployed on your computer locally, in the field, or on the worldwide web. However, given the limited availability of experts, prohibitive costs to annotate footage, and the expansion of imaging as an engagement tool and sensing modality, novel methods for automated annotation of underwater visual data are desperately needed. This need is motivating deployment of artificial intelligence and data science tools in the ocean realm. Automating analysis of visual data using artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad term that encompasses advanced statistical methods, machine learning, supervised and unsupervised learning, and deep learning or convolutional neural networks (CNNs)14, 15. Statistical methods that include random forests have been successfully used in the plankton imaging community, achieving automated classification of microscale plants and animals with accuracies greater than 90%16, 17. Unsupervised learning has been used to identify regions or moments of interest in underwater video footage during vehicle deployments and post-processing annotation tasks. Although unsupervised learning can be deployed with minimal data and a priori knowledge of underwater scenes, these algorithms have limited application to automating the detection and classification of objects in underwater imagery with sufficient granularity and detail to be used for annotation. Supervised learning, or CNNs that are trained on visual data where all objects have been identified (Figure 1), has improved performance of automated annotation and classification tasks to the genus and species level. Given the potential for CNNs to automate the annotation and classification of animals to lower taxonomic levels, the underwater imaging community has called out the need for publicly available, large-scale image training sets.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to oral cancer screening has recently been proposed. This scoping review analyzed the information about different machine learning tools in support of non-invasive diagnostic techniques including telemedicine, medical images, fluorescence images, exfoliative cytology and predictor variables at risk of developing oral cancer. The results suggest that such tools can make a noninvasive contribution to the early diagnosis of oral cancer and we express the gaps of the proposed questions to be improved in new investigations. Abstract The early diagnosis of cancer can facilitate subsequent clinical patient management. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been found to be promising for improving the diagnostic process. The aim of the present study is to increase the evidence on the application of AI to the early diagnosis of oral cancer through a scoping review. A search was performed in the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar databases during the period from January 2000 to December 2020, referring to the early non-invasive diagnosis of oral cancer based on AI applied to screening. Only accessible full-text articles were considered. Thirty-six studies were included on the early detection of oral cancer based on images (photographs (optical imaging and enhancement technology) and cytology) with the application of AI models. These studies were characterized by their heterogeneous nature. Each publication involved a different algorithm with potential training data bias and few comparative data for AI interpretation. Artificial intelligence may play an important role in precisely predicting the development of oral cancer, though several methodological issues need to be addressed in parallel to the advances in AI techniques, in order to allow large-scale transfer of the latter to population-based detection protocols.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"a14181f0aac6c25e2c9c8064ec1a96e83b7290d9\", \"abstract\": \"Computational machine learning, especially self-enhancing algorithms, prove remarkable effectiveness in applications, including cardiovascular medicine.

Due to the concerns surrounding global warming and extreme ecological effects, flooding is considered a serious problem that has a negative impact on infrastructure and humankind.

However, a growing concern is that due to unequal access to computing power, only certain firms and elite universities have advantages in modern AI research. Using a novel dataset of 171394 papers from 57 prestigious computer science conferences, we document that firms, in particular, large technology firms and elite universities have increased participation in major AI conferences since deep learning's unanticipated rise in 2012. The effect is concentrated among elite universities, which are ranked 1-50 in the QS World University Rankings. Further, we find two strategies through which firms increased their presence in AI research: first, they have increased firm-only publications; and second, firms are collaborating primarily with elite universities. Consequently, this increased presence of firms and elite universities in AI research has crowded out mid-tier (QS ranked 201-300) and lower-tier (QS ranked 301-500) universities. To provide causal evidence that deep learning's unanticipated rise resulted in this divergence, we leverage the generalized synthetic control method, a data-driven counterfactual estimator.

Larson. Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2021. 312 pages. Hardcover; $29.95. ISBN: 9780674983519. *The Myth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a technical and philosophical introduction to AI with an emphasis on AI's limitations. Larson, a computer scientist and tech entrepreneur, keeps his central claim modest: true general AI is neither inevitable nor imminent, and if it is possible, it will require fundamentally new approaches. It is an easy read, combining references to fiction, history, and science. It lays out a bird's eye view of the origins and ideas behind current AI methods, focusing on general AI, a category of AI that would need to learn and engage with a wide variety of problems. *Separated into three parts, The Myth of AI begins with the history and algorithmic logic of AI, largely through the lens of the Turing test. Larson argues that we are not near the singularity (superintelligent computers able to create ever more intelligent machines) and that, in fact, the basic premise of the singularity is flawed. *The second part discusses inference. AI falls short of human intelligence because it can work with hard rules, but cannot make the guesses necessary to formulate new ones or handle uncertain rules. In attempts at the Turing test, AI can throw data at the problem but will always lack understanding. Achieving the understanding necessary for true intelligence will require an approach fundamentally different from recent advances made in AI, which are only effective for narrow AI (a category of AI for solving specialized problems) and not general AI. *The final, and relatively brief, part examines AI in science. According to Larson's assessment, new scientific research relies heavily on newly available computation power and big data in order to use narrow AI to its full extent. Larson claims that this approach will hinder development of new theories. He also claims that this leads to treating scientists as if they were computers as well, which causes overvaluing the system of science above people. He criticizes \\\"swarm science,\\\" which he describes as a large group of scientists approaching one problem with a variety of projects, emphasizing this collaboration over the individuals. Instead, he claims, we need our culture to continue to emphasize individual discovery and intelligence, as it is the key to innovation. *Through the discussions of the history, philosophy, and logic of AI in the first two parts of the book, Larson disentangles the hype of AI from what is actually possible with current technology. Even as he sheds light on the gap between the singularity prediction and what machine learning is truly capable of, he emphasizes the significance of the myth. \\\"The myth is an emotional lighthouse by which we navigate the AI topic\\\" (p. 76). The stories we tell through predictions and science fiction define AI in the public eye and set the goals for AI research. *Our underlying philosophy matters as much as the current state of AI research, when we consider the social role of AI and what we predict for our future. In the development of AI, we must define intelligence and explore what it means to be human. While this is not a book with overtly religious claims, it does acknowledge the spiritual claims inherent in discussions of personhood. It also frames technoscience as replacing philosophy and religion and as the oversimplified understanding of humanity and the precursor to expectations of the singularity. *Beyond the stated goal of disenchanting the reader of the inevitability of AI, the book highlights the significance of stories to both society and science and emphasizes the importance of understanding for both humans and AI. We need to understand not only the technical aspects of the technology we build but also the philosophy that defines our goals. *While I found the first two sections of the book to be an engaging and accurate discussion of the tension between the science and hopes of AI, I had concerns about the warnings of \\\"swarm science\\\" in the third. Larson is placing a strong emphasis on individual genius in science; however, science has never been a truly independent endeavor. Many times in history, from evolution to DNA, multiple teams of scientists independently made the same discoveries at nearly the same time, based on previously published work. Though these discoveries were not inevitable, they built upon other research and relied on collaboration at least as much as individual genius. Larson focuses on a particular neuroscience project and makes some valid criticisms, but then he generalizes his observations to all of science in ways that I do not believe to be accurate. His argument that all of science is moving away from theory toward shallow observations is not as obvious as he claims, nor is it supported by the evidence offered in the book. *As a counterexample, the research that resulted in the COVID-19 vaccine could be considered \\\"swarm science\\\" and was effective. Large amounts of funding were very suddenly directed to many scientists for one goal: understand and prevent the coronavirus. Due to both new funding and established research, we developed and approved multiple vaccines in one year. I was not convinced of several of Larson's generalizations in this third section. Tension between celebrating collaboration and individual genius will persist. However, it appears that there is more collaboration in science today. This is likely due to a variety of reasons, including a scientific community connected by the internet and more contributors receiving appropriate credit for their work. *The Myth of AI is a broad view of AI that should prove valuable and comprehensible to readers with or without a technical background. The first two sections offer a clear explanation and history of AI, and the third offers food for thought on how the process of science has been shaped by advances in AI and computer technology. The first sections would be a good introduction to someone not familiar with AI or looking to think about the philosophy of AI and I\\u00ac\\u2020would recommend the book for these sections. *While the book avoids religious claims, the philosophical discussions of what it means to \\\"understand\\\" and the level of trust we place in AI are essential questions for Christians working in technology-related disciplines. The Myth of AI presents a jumping-off point for much deeper reflection about using AI responsibly and what it means to be human. *Reviewed by Elizabeth Koning, graduate student in the Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"adb01374d2f7167761b7a752964c01c3a80c1b62\", \"abstract\": \"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have promised to revolutionize the way we live and work, and one of particularly promising areas for AI is image analysis.

Health and medical journals now commonly include reports on machine learning and big data, and descriptions of the risks posed by, and the governance required to manage, this technology. Machine learning algorithms are used to make diagnoses, identify treatments and analyse public health threats, and these systems can learn and improve continuously in response to new data. The tension between risks and concerns on one hand versus potential and opportunity on the other has shaped this issue of the Bulletin of the World Health Organization on the new ethical challenges of artificial intelligence in public health. Data-driven discovery and analysis in health care can increase knowledge and efficiency as well as challenge social values related to privacy, data control and the monetization of personal information. In India, for example, the adoption of a system for assigning all citizens a unique identification number, linking it to individual health records and several health-related schemes, raises ethical, legal and social issues, and the need for an appropriate ethical framework and data governance.1 These issues might be particularly challenging in lowand middle-income countries. Trust is perhaps the overarching theme of the contributions to this issue, and it is indeed one of the central values in digital health. One article explores opportunities for a human-centric ethical and regulatory environment to support the evolution of trust-based artificial intelligence with special regard to health insurance.2 Likewise, trust plays a role along with empathy and compassion in the humane side of care, the importance of which must be preserved in exploring the kind of health care society ought to promote.3 Similarly, European Union guidance might be too context-specific and as such leaves too much room for local, contextualized discretion for it to foster trustworthy artificial intelligence globally.4 In the context of population health research, researchers propose a post-research review model for ethics governance of research using artificial intelligence.5 For mobile health research in behavioural science, machine learning tools pose novel challenges for transparency, privacy, consent and the management of adverse events, all of which point to the need for consensusbased guidelines.6 As use of artificial intelligence systems expands, accountability for harm to patients and responsibility for their safety entail the need for human control and understanding of these systems.7 Other safeguards will require deliberate investments in data quality, access to care and processes to minimize bias, all in the service of trustworthiness.8 Success in integrating artificial intelligence into everyday patient care, as for instance in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\\u2019s National Health Service, is dependent on transparency, accountability and trust.9 In addition to trust, the values of fairness, justice and equity are seen as posing challenges even if other ethical duties are met. If artificial intelligence systems can explicitly improve equity, it is also a requirement that they do not worsen inequity.10 Thus, the case of neglected tropical diseases in low-resource settings illustrates opportunities for improved public health, as well as new challenges.11 Globally, the potential to help address some shortages and unmet needs in public health and care services might be realized by artificial intelligence-controlled conversational agents or chatbots that give health advice. However, realizing this potential will require the collaborative establishment of best practices and international ethics guidelines for technologies that replace humans.12 The field of bioethics emerged and grew in response to the development of new technologies and, sometimes, related wrongdoing. Ensuring adequate education, governance and ongoing ethical scrutiny will be essential if we are to realize the benefits and minimize the risks of this new technology. Questions of artificial intelligence accountability, equity and inclusiveness remain. The field is quickly evolving, and more artificial intelligence-based applications and services are becoming available in high-income countries. Identifying better tools for benefit-sharing and, simultaneously, evidence-based safeguards and criteria for appropriate uses and users to benefit everyone, including those in middleand lowincome countries, is essential. The World Health Organization (WHO) has made a commitment to addressing ethics, governance and regulation of artificial intelligence for health. In late 2019, WHO established an expert group to help develop a global framework for ethics and governance in artificial intelligence. The goal of this initiative is to ensure that these technologies are aligned with the overarching aims of promoting fair and equitable global health, meeting human rights standards and supporting Member States\\u2019 commitments to achieve universal health coverage. \\u25a0 Balancing risks and benefits of artificial intelligence in the health sector Kenneth Goodman, Diana Zandi, Andreas Reis & Effy Vayena\"}, {\"paperId\": \"dab040238280354a35b648cde5aff1e449e5be76\", \"abstract\": \"Widespread adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has resulted in the collection of massive amounts of clinical data. In ophthalmology in particular, the volume range of data captured in EHR systems has been growing rapidly. Yet making effective secondary use of this EHR data for improving patient care and facilitating clinical decision-making has remained challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of these data. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques present a promising way to analyze these multimodal data sets. While AI techniques have been extensively applied to imaging data, there are a limited number of studies employing AI techniques with clinical data from the EHR. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of different AI methods applied to EHR data in the field of ophthalmology. This literature review highlights that the secondary use of EHR data has focused on glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and cataracts with the use of AI techniques. These techniques have been used to improve ocular disease diagnosis, risk assessment, and progression prediction. Techniques such as supervised machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing were most commonly used in the articles reviewed.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"65daaf915c0b9c6a7bcad1e40b4b46ff5551405c\", \"abstract\": \"The impact parameter is one of the crucial physical quantities of heavy-ion collisions (HICs), and can affect obviously many observables at the final state, such as the multifragmentation and the collective flow. Usually, it cannot be measured directly in experiments but might be inferred from observables at the final state. Artificial intelligence has had great success in learning complex representations of data, which enables novel modeling and data processing approaches in physical sciences. In this article, we employ two of commonly used algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to improve the accuracy of determining impact parameter by analyzing the proton spectra in transverse momentum and rapidity on the event-by-event basis. Au+Au collisions with the impact parameter of 0$\\\\leq$$b$$\\\\leq$10 fm at intermediate energies ($E_{\\\\rm lab}$=$0.2$-$1.0$ GeV$/$nucleon) are simulated with the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics (UrQMD) model to generate the proton spectra data. It is found that the average difference between the true impact parameter and the estimated one can be smaller than 0.1 fm. The LightGBM algorithm shows an improved performance with respect to the CNN on the task in this work. By using the LightGBM's visualization algorithm, one can obtain the important feature map of the distribution of transverse momentum and rapidity, which may be helpful in inferring the impact parameter or centrality in heavy-ion experiments.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"c0bff32c9b92b6cf76acc426a0be4eb0d930a300\", \"abstract\": \"Medical practitioners bring a diverse set of cognitive capabilities to bear on their work. Clinical history-taking, for example, requires that providers start with a range of previous probabilities across diseases and ask a series of dynamic questions that efficiently refine these possibilities, with each question building on an evaluation of previous answers. Decisions are also guided by past experiences, and practitioners intuitively develop causal models predicting responses to specific scenarios such as how patients might react to being told that they need a surgical procedure. As part of learning, the provider compares the actual response to expectation and refines the model to guide the next set of actions. The pursuit of artificial intelligence, in its original conception, involved training machines to replicate all these capabilities.1 Artificial intelligence, as so defined, remains in its infancy, more suited to science fiction than actual practice. But in some areas relevant to medicine\\u2014specifically pattern recognition tasks\\u2014machines have begun to narrow the gap with humans. In this issue, Huang and colleagues2 use a class of machine learning models, multilayer convolutional neural networks, to carry out a specific task: detecting wall motion abnormalities (WMAs) in echocardiogram videos. They use 3 different types of models to (1) identify the viewpoint of the video (eg, parasternal long axis); (2) \\u201csegment\\u201d or delineate the images into component regions; and (3) detect WMAs in these regions. They compare model performances to that of human readers as the gold standard and, crucially, replicate these results with data from a second institution. Just 10 years ago, the idea of a machine performing these tasks would have seemed the stuff of science fiction (albeit perhaps not the most riveting plot). Today, this represents an eminently feasible application of algorithms that have been used to automatically generate descriptive captions for YouTube videos3 or transform a modern photograph into an Impressionist rendering of the same scene.4 The common thread across these applications enables us to use this article as a starting point to describe the recent evolution of computer vision as a discipline, its application to medicine, and whether, more soberingly, such applications are likely ever to be used in practice. Five years ago, I lamented how many of the most popular machine learning algorithms have been available for decades and yet have made almost no inroads into clinical practice.5 It is worth considering whether this statement should be revised today and, if not, speculating on what is still needed. Before the late 2000s, much of machine learning focused on combining handengineered features in models to perform tasks such as image classification (eg, differentiating images of an apple from those of a banana) or regression (estimating a numeric parameter such as humidity).

So I set out to find out. My research tells me AI and machine learning or machine intelligence are terms used in computer science for \\u2018intelligence\\u2019 demonstrated by machines like computers, as opposed to the \\u2018natural intelligence\\u2019 of humans and some other animals and birds (Fig. 1). The concept of intelligent machines was considered and described by science fiction writers like Isaac Asimov before they became real. Mary Shelley, daughter of feminist Mary Wollstonecraft and wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley, started writing Frankenstein, the story of an artificial being, in 1815 when she was only 18. Douglas Adams invented an Electric Monk which believed things for you in order to save you the bother of believing everything the world expected you to believe. The word intelligent comes from the Latin intelligere, meaning to understand. Is a computer that beats a chess grandmaster actually intelligent or just well programmed? Alan Turing, the brilliant English mathematician who worked at Bletchley Park during World War II breaking German ciphers, whose work led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain, suggested a better question was not whether a machine was intelligent, but whether machines could exhibit intelligent behaviour. Incidentally, despite being a war hero, Turing was prosecuted for \\u2018gross indecency\\u2019 for the then crime of being homosexual and was \\u2018chemically castrated\\u2019. In 1954, at age 41, Turing died after taking cyanide. In 2009, the British Parliament pardoned Turing and apologised to him for having persecuted him. In 1956, a young mathematician John McCarthy organised a workshop on thinking machines at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire. He proposed a 2-month, 10-man study of \\u2018artificial intelligence\\u2019, the first ever use of the term. People came and went at the workshop. Rather wonderfully, McCarthy lost his list of attendees. Enthusiasm for AI waxed and waned. The late 1970s when funding was withdrawn were called the \\u2018AI winter\\u2019, but that winter of discontent has matured into a burgeoning springtime of AI use, including in multiple areas of health care. AI is more than just computerising tasks; it builds on and develops computing capabilities. AI is about how machines \\u2018learn\\u2019 the associations between things by being repeatedly exposed to data. They are agnostic as to whether or not those associations make a priori sense or are logical. AI is increasingly being used in diagnosis, treatment and research. In dermatology, AI systems get feedback data from scanned skin biopsies and gradually improve their diagnostic accuracy based on the data, although systems are not yet sufficiently reliable to be used as the exclusive determinant of which skin lesions need biopsy. Computer technology is being used in pharmacies to assist with drug dosing and even with choice of drugs. One use in research is to aid in sample-size determination. On a positive note, if reliable, AI applications have enormous potential to improve information use in resource poor settings. A literature search for AI yields lots of articles on robots. Although there is no universally agreed definition of AI, most experts agree that a robot that simply automates a task is not AI, because AI involves significant learning. Current robotic surgery has a master\\u2013slave basis; true artificially intelligent robotic surgery is still a way off. Surgeons are rapidly training themselves in using robot-assisted (minimally invasive) surgery to operate on adults with proven or suspected malignancy, gynaecological problems including tubal sterilisation, and prostatic hypertrophy. There is less use of robots in children, although there are reports of paediatric robot-assisted surgery being used to perform pyeloplasty in the USA and to treat solid tumours in the UK, albeit with little or no evaluation as yet of the advantages and disadvantages. The names are great. The main US robotic surgical system is called the da Vinci Surgical System, a fitting tribute to the 16th century polymath, vegetarian, liberator of caged birds, so beloved of paediatricians (Fig. 2).

Its fast development is powered by theoretical advancement, big data, computer hardware (e.g, the graphics processing unit, GPU) and high-performance computing platforms that support the development, training, and deployment of AI models within reasonable amount of time. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), which is the integration of geospatial studies and AI, especially machine learning and deep learning methods and latest AI technologies in both academia and industry. GeoAI can be regarded as a study subject to develop intelligent computer programs to mimic the processes of human perception, spatial reasoning, and discovery about geographical phenomena and dynamics, to advance our knowledge, and to solve problems in human environmental systems and their interactions with a focus on spatial contexts and roots in geography or geographic information science (GIScience). Thus, it would require the knowledge of AI theory, programming and computation practices as well as geographic domain knowledge to be competent in GeoAI research. There have already been increasingly collaborative GeoAI studies for GIScience, remote sensing, physical environment and human society. It is a good time to provide a key reference list for educators, students, researchers, and practitioners to keep up with the latest GeoAI research topics. This bibliographical entry will first review the historical roots for AI in geography and GIScience and then list up to 10 selective recent works with annotations that briefly describe their importance for each topic of interest in the GeoAI landscape, ranging from fundamental spatial representation learning to spatial predictions and to various advancements in cartography, earth observation, social sensing and geospatial semantics.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"302709061a86e34ced9a744db6b922fba2866059\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"4cbaa4cd3f5b5203c022b0c2751aa60d5c9defba\", \"abstract\": \"Artificial intelligence (A.I.) is moving into every aspect of our lives: selecting the online advertisements that we see, recognizing our voices, and providing automated answers when we speak to customer service helpline chatbots. Machine learning, a form of A.I. that involves computers learning and improving without being explicitly programmed, is now considered a fully mature technology and is being used across a wide variety of industries. For example, the banking industry uses machine-learning algorithms to comb through vast amounts of transactional data to combat credit card fraud, while the automotive industry uses machine learning to predict when parts might fail and when servicing will be required.1 Medicine is traditionally slower than other industries to develop and adopt new technologies, but A.I. is beginning to enter clinical practice to complement the expertise of health care practitioners in fields such as radiology.2 A.I. and machine learning bear similar promise in anesthesiology, but many challenges remain in incorporating machine learning into daily clinical practice.3 To date, most A.I. projects published in the medical literature have focused on the development and validation of machine-learning models and algorithms. A small minority of these reports describe a project that has been integrated successfully into daily clinical workflow, and few, if any A.I. efforts have demonstrated measurable improvements in patient outcomes.

A breakthrough Innovation Trigger leads to proofs-of-concept and significant publicity, but initially, no usable or commercially viable products exist. As publicity continues, development does not yet meet the expectations of the wider field, attitudes begin to harden, and general interest wanes in a Trough of Disillusionment. Slowly, the technology evolves along the Slope of Enlightenment and a greater number of examples of benefit emerge and are understood.

For some, machine learning and AI in medicine may be associated with technology taking the place of humanphysician led medical expertise. For others, the idea of machine learning in medicine is seen as an example of technology advancement. Regardless, it is a concept that is gaining traction and attention because of the abundance of possibilities related to this technology.

If you use an internet search engine, you will obtain even more search results for this term. So what is machine learning? Machine learning is based on algorithms that utilize statistics to identify patterns. It provides a system that can automatically learn from experience \\u2013 but experience based on data and not based on human experience or reaction. This technology is heavily employed in many day-to-day services, including video and music streaming sites, social media sites, and voice assistant services. In these instances, data are collected and machine learning predicts what you will want next. So how can machine learning be applied to pediatric gastroenterology? In the January 2020 issue of Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (JPGN), Patel et al provided an in-depth review of AI and machine learning applied to gastrointestinal diagnostics. This review discussed important terminology within the practice of machine learning that is essential to understanding the science behind this technology (1). As discussed within this review, AI has applications within gastrointestinal endoscopy (polyp detection, celiac disease, IBD), endomicroscopy, video capsule endoscopy, and radiographic imaging interpretation (1). In this month\\u2019s issue of JPGN, Dhaliwal et al explore one such possible application of machine learning within pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) \\u2013 differentiation of colonic IBD. Differentiation of ulcerative colitis (UC) from Crohn disease is a difficult process and has been a topic of multiple publications itself, including a 2007 clinical report from NASPGHAN and CCFA (2), and more recently, diagnostic criteria published by the Pediatric IBD (PIBD) Porto group of ESPGHAN (3). As mentioned by Dhaliwal et al, the PIBD classification algorithm focuses on features pointing away from a diagnosis of UC. In their machine-learning model, the authors evaluated 73 patients and 28 specific disease features. Their model not only incorporated features from the PIBD algorithm but also included disease features typical of UC (primarily histologic features\\u2014see Table 1 of publication). Through machine-learning analysis of disease features, they were able to identify 7 features (3 histologic and 4 endoscopic\\u2014see Table 2 of publication) that accurately distinguished between UC and colonic CD. As my music streaming service often reminds me, interaction (thus submitting more data) within the service improves algorithm accuracy. Similar could be said for this study, which represented a specific patient population from a single center. The power of this publication may not be its immediate generalization to pediatric IBD in its entirety. The concept and potential performance of an AIbased diagnostic algorithm within pediatric IBD is, however, promising. AI and machine learning have the potential to analyze large data sets, provide meaningful data-driven algorithms free of human bias, and could contribute to data-driven standard care practices. Variation in care is a known issue throughout medicine, including pediatric IBD (4). Utilizing models, such as this may help us in our quest to become better physicians, making informed diagnoses and decisions that lead to improved patient outcomes. The study by Dhaliwal et al is a step in this direction. Ideas and models such as this are likely to shape the practice of medicine in the future. Human emotion, reaction, and experience should never be completely removed from the art of medicine but utilization of technology can improve the science of medicine and further our ability to care for our patients. Change is on the horizon; count me in the camp that views AI and machine learning as important technology innovation.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"78a0158a5bb51786142f79f494648f51070da327\", \"abstract\": \"Background Significant investments and advances in health care technologies and practices have created a need for digital and data-literate health care providers.

Objective The aim of this study is to accelerate the appropriate adoption of data-driven and AI-enhanced care by focusing on the mindsets, skillsets, and toolsets of point-of-care health providers and their leaders in the health system. Methods To accelerate the adoption of AI and the need for organizational change at a national level, our multistepped approach includes creating awareness and capacity building, learning through innovation and adoption, developing appropriate and strategic partnerships, and building effective knowledge exchange initiatives. Education interventions designed to adapt knowledge to the local context and address any challenges to knowledge use include engagement activities to increase awareness, educational curricula for health care providers and leaders, and the development of a coaching and practice-based innovation hub. Framed by the Knowledge-to-Action framework, we are currently in the knowledge creation stage to inform the curricula for each deliverable. An environmental scan and scoping review were conducted to understand the current state of AI education programs as reported in the academic literature. Results The environmental scan identified 24 AI-accredited programs specific to health providers, of which 11 were from the United States, 6 from Canada, 4 from the United Kingdom, and 3 from Asian countries. The most common curriculum topics across the environmental scan and scoping review included AI fundamentals, applications of AI, applied machine learning in health care, ethics, data science, and challenges to and opportunities for using AI. Conclusions Technologies are advancing more rapidly than organizations, and professionals can adopt and adapt to them. To help shape AI practices, health care providers must have the skills and abilities to initiate change and shape the future of their discipline and practices for advancing high-quality care within the digital ecosystem.

Using cognitive network science, we modeled every recall list as a bag-of-words (BOW) vector and as a walk over a network representation of semantic memory\\u2014in this case, free associations. This weights BOW entries according to their centrality (degree) in semantic memory and informs recalls using semantic network distances, thus embedding recalls in a cognitive representation. This embedding translated into state-of-the-art, cross-validated predictions for depression (R = 0.7), anxiety (R = 0.44), and stress (R = 0.52), equivalent to previous results employing additional human data. Powered by a multilayer perceptron neural network, DASentimental opens the door to probing the semantic organizations of emotional distress. We found that semantic distances between recalls (i.e., walk coverage), was key for estimating depression levels but redundant for anxiety and stress levels. Semantic distances from \\u201cfear\\u201d boosted anxiety predictions but were redundant when the \\u201csad\\u2013happy\\u201d dyad was considered. We applied DASentimental to a clinical dataset of 142 suicide notes and found that the predicted depression and anxiety levels (high/low) corresponded to differences in valence and arousal as expected from a circumplex model of affect. We discuss key directions for future research enabled by artificial intelligence detecting stress, anxiety, and depression in texts.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"66e70d7d6af0c51b9b907d9c4a8de0dfca70b1a7\", \"abstract\": \"There have been tremendous advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) within the past decade, especially in the application of deep learning to various challenges. These include advanced competitive games (such as Chess and Go), self-driving cars, speech recognition, and intelligent personal assistants. Rapid advances in computer vision for recognition of objects in pictures have led some individuals, including computer science experts and health care system experts in machine learning, to make predictions that ML algorithms will soon lead to the replacement of the radiologist. However, there are complex technological, regulatory, and medicolegal obstacles facing the implementation of machine learning in radiology that will definitely preclude replacement of the radiologist by these algorithms within the next two decades and beyond. While not a comprehensive review of machine learning, this article is intended to highlight specific features of machine learning which face significant technological and health care systems challenges. Rather than replacing radiologists, machine learning will provide quantitative tools that will increase the value of diagnostic imaging as a biomarker, increase image quality with decreased acquisition times, and improve workflow, communication, and patient safety. In the foreseeable future, we predict that today's generation of radiologists will be replaced not by ML algorithms, but by a new breed of data science-savvy radiologists who have embraced and harnessed the incredible potential that machine learning has to advance our ability to care for our patients.

Yet, buzz words like big data and AI mystify many clinicians and biomedical researchers. Their widespread use in other industries and initial clinical applications can serve as a guide to a clearer understanding of what they are and are not, their promise, and their potential peril. Many common terms mean different things in different contexts. AI typically refers to a machine with human capabilities; machine learning (ML) may refer either to a set of computational and statistical tools for identifying relationships in data or to the use of such tools to make predictions based on data; deep neural networks are a particular type of ML whose success at tasks, such as image recognition, has led to them being referred to as AI or deep learning. Developing most AI, ML, and deep neural network tools requires access to big data\\u2014another concept with multiple meanings. For data scientists, it implies using more data than one computer can handle with significant attendant analytical and computational challenges and opportunities; for clinicians and biomedical researchers, it refers to complex datasets with numerous structured and unstructured data fields, such as those typically found in electronic health records. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between AI, ML, deep neural networks, and big data. Reinforcement learning is a notable exception to the use of big data to train AI. It is an approach to building AI tools based only on feedback. For example, DeepMind program AlphaGo Zero became the most powerful Go program in the world solely by playing against itself. Thus far, reinforcement learning in health care has been developed using historical data representing decisions and feedback. If (when) AI starts to make and test clinical decisions, algorithms will have the capacity to learn on their own. The widespread use of AI by companies such as Amazon and Google offers lessons for health care. Such industries have applied AI to enable smart electronic assistants, facial recognition software, and self-driving cars; the use and misuse of such applications have raised concerns about safety, fairness, and privacy. For example, data are increasingly being used to predict consumer behavior and preferences. Do I want the computers at a department store to know that I am pregnant before my family does? Will I be charged more for plane tickets if I buy them using an iPhone? There are numerous proof-of-concept examples of ML in health care. It has been applied to clinical risk prediction and to learning from the large volume of data generated by electronic health records and other large datasets. Notable recent examples include the classification of a picture of a nevus as malignant or benign, of a retinal fundus image to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease, and of using histopathology specimens to predict prognosis in lung cancer. In everyday clinical cardiology, ML has been used for interpreting automated ECG, determine left ventricular ejection fractions from echocardiography, and scoring coronary artery calcium scans. A form of AI known as computer vision is being developed to prevent clinical errors and improve patient safety. Although relatively few of these methods have been implemented in routine clinical practice, and none on a large scale, they demonstrate the promise of AI in clinical medicine and biomedical research. AI can be used to automate and simplify tasks too onerous or time-consuming for a single person or team to perform. What if we could use voice recognition software as a medical scribe to allow more doctoring and less documenting in patient exam rooms? What if we could aggregate a personalized cohort to ask simple, clinically relevant questions with a few clicks of our mouse? Research teams at Stanford University have developed a variety of approaches to leveraging data found in the electronic health record to help clinicians make decisions based on a patient\\u2019s unique characteristics. One such approach allows a physician considering a decision to call for an informatics consult. This triggers an ML algorithm that identifies patients similar to the one being considered and presents their treatments and outcomes. Similar tools could be used to quickly identify patients who meet criteria for entry into randomized clinical trials, dramatically cutting enrollment and recruitment costs. In translational research, ML can efficiently identify candidate molecules for drug development. ML can better risk stratify populations underrepresented in our available evidence base and identify patterns and relationships not captured by traditional statistical methods.

Bergen et al. review how these methods can be applied to solid Earth datasets. Adopting machine-learning techniques is important for extracting information and for understanding the increasing amount of complex data collected in the geosciences. Science, this issue p. eaau0323 BACKGROUND The solid Earth, oceans, and atmosphere together form a complex interacting geosystem. Processes relevant to understanding Earth\\u2019s geosystem behavior range in spatial scale from the atomic to the planetary, and in temporal scale from milliseconds to billions of years. Physical, chemical, and biological processes interact and have substantial influence on this complex geosystem, and humans interact with it in ways that are increasingly consequential to the future of both the natural world and civilization as the finiteness of Earth becomes increasingly apparent and limits on available energy, mineral resources, and fresh water increasingly affect the human condition. Earth is subject to a variety of geohazards that are poorly understood, yet increasingly impactful as our exposure grows through increasing urbanization, particularly in hazard-prone areas. We have a fundamental need to develop the best possible predictive understanding of how the geosystem works, and that understanding must be informed by both the present and the deep past. This understanding will come through the analysis of increasingly large geo-datasets and from computationally intensive simulations, often connected through inverse problems. Geoscientists are faced with the challenge of extracting as much useful information as possible and gaining new insights from these data, simulations, and the interplay between the two. Techniques from the rapidly evolving field of machine learning (ML) will play a key role in this effort. ADVANCES The confluence of ultrafast computers with large memory, rapid progress in ML algorithms, and the ready availability of large datasets place geoscience at the threshold of dramatic progress. We anticipate that this progress will come from the application of ML across three categories of research effort: (i) automation to perform a complex prediction task that cannot easily be described by a set of explicit commands; (ii) modeling and inverse problems to create a representation that approximates numerical simulations or captures relationships; and (iii) discovery to reveal new and often unanticipated patterns, structures, or relationships. Examples of automation include geologic mapping using remote-sensing data, characterizing the topology of fracture systems to model subsurface transport, and classifying volcanic ash particles to infer eruptive mechanism. Examples of modeling include approximating the viscoelastic response for complex rheology, determining wave speed models directly from tomographic data, and classifying diverse seismic events. Examples of discovery include predicting laboratory slip events using observations of acoustic emissions, detecting weak earthquake signals using similarity search, and determining the connectivity of subsurface reservoirs using groundwater tracer observations. OUTLOOK The use of ML in solid Earth geosciences is growing rapidly, but is still in its early stages and making uneven progress. Much remains to be done with existing datasets from long-standing data sources, which in many cases are largely unexplored. Newer, unconventional data sources such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fiber-optic sensing, and crowd-sourced measurements may demand new approaches through both the volume and the character of information that they present. Practical steps could accelerate and broaden the use of ML in the geosciences. Wider adoption of open-science principles such as open source code, open data, and open access will better position the solid Earth community to take advantage of rapid developments in ML and artificial intelligence. Benchmark datasets and challenge problems have played an important role in driving progress in artificial intelligence research by enabling rigorous performance comparison and could play a similar role in the geosciences. Testing on high-quality datasets produces better models, and benchmark datasets make these data widely available to the research community. They also help recruit expertise from allied disciplines. Close collaboration between geoscientists and ML researchers will aid in making quick progress in ML geoscience applications. Extracting maximum value from geoscientific data will require new approaches for combining data-driven methods, physical modeling, and algorithms capable of learning with limited, weak, or biased labels. Funding opportunities that target the intersection of these disciplines, as well as a greater component of data science and ML education in the geosciences, could help bring this effort to fruition.

AI can be categorized into symbolic AI such as expert systems and machine learning (ML), which includes deep learning. Technically, recently mentioned AI refers to ML or deep learning. Deep learning, which is inspired by biological neurons, is a subcategory of machine learning algorithms [5]. Machine learning (including deep learning) requires a large amount of training data to improve performance. Therefore, to implement a good healthcare AI system, we need a vast amount of healthcare data. Many people believe there is a large amount of data in hospitals based on the wide adaptation of electronic medical records (EMR). They mentioned that the adoption rate of EMR in the United States was dramatically increased to 97% after the introduction of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act [6] and the adoption rate of EMR in Korea is more than 92%. Nearly all hospitals in Korea also use the computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system. However, the EMR adoption rate is only 58.1%, and the fully comprehensive EMR adoption rate has dropped to 11.6% [7]. This implies a lack of digitalized data for healthcare AI research in Korea. Even though there is a large amount of data, having only a large quantity of data based on big data concepts may fail to achieve an applicable healthcare AI system. We need well-curated and labeled data. For example, 54 US licensed ophthalmologists and ophthalmology senior residents have reviewed 128,175 retinal images to build a well-curated dataset [3]. Current digitalized medical records require more in-depth curation to be used for research. Moreover, to realize precision medicine with the aid of AI methods, we need many new healthcare data types including genome and wearable data.

To accomplish this, smart cities necessitate collaboration among the public as well as private sectors to install IT platforms to collect and examinemassive quantities of data. At the same time, it is essential to design effective artificial intelligence (AI) based tools to handle healthcare crisis situations in smart cities. To offer proficient services to people during healthcare crisis time, the authorities need to look closer towards them. Sentiment analysis (SA) in social networking can provide valuable information regarding public opinion towards government actions. With this motivation, this paper presents a new AI based SA tool for healthcare crisis management (AISA-HCM) in smart cities. The AISA-HCM technique aims to determine the emotions of the people during the healthcare crisis time, such as COVID-19. The proposed AISA-HCM technique involves distinct operations such as pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification. Besides, brain stormoptimization (BSO) with deep belief network (DBN), called BSODBN model is employed for feature extraction. Moreover, beetle antenna search with extreme learning machine (BAS-ELM) method was utilized for classifying the sentiments as to various classes. The use of BSO and BAS algorithms helps to effectively modify the parameters involved in the DBN andELMmodels respectively. The performance validation of the AISA-HCM technique takes place using Twitter data and the outcomes are examined with respect to various measures. The experimental outcomes highlighted the enhanced performance of the AISA-HCM technique over the recent state of art SA approaches with the maximum precision of 0.89, recall of 0.88, Fmeasure of 0.89, and accuracy of 0.94. \\u00a9 2022 Tech Science Press.

Imagination has been defined as the capacity to mentally transcend time, place, and/or circumstance. Much of the success of AI currently comes from a revolution in data science, specifically the use of deep learning neural networks to extract structure from data. This paper argues for the development of a new field called imagination science, which extends data science beyond its current realm of learning probability distributions from samples. Numerous examples are given in the paper to illustrate that human achievements in the arts, literature, poetry, and science may lie beyond the realm of data science, because they require abilities that go beyond finding correlations: for example, generating samples from a novel probability distribution different from the one given during training; causal reasoning to uncover interpretable explanations; or analogical reasoning to generalize to novel situations (e.g., imagination in art, representing alien life in a distant galaxy, understanding a story about talking animals, or inventing representations to model the large-scale structure of the universe). We describe the key challenges in automating imagination, discuss connections between ongoing research and imagination, and outline why automation of imagination provides a powerful launching pad for transforming AI.\\n \\n\"}, {\"paperId\": \"6d1f0f9286abe336c94ecc15977734fa8a6e28e5\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"80d696da9403b70d62c3eb855169876022d84f72\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"149117c1e121fc8797379eda21803db7b9d9ba03\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"5342abeb08fdc128b8cf1af17276ace5aa0fdd11\", \"abstract\": \"Statistics is a science of data collection. Although a science, it is actually a branch of mathematics. In statistics, data-sets are distributed in such a way that they form a certain shape, the most common of which is the bell-shaped curve known also as the bell curve, normal distribution and the Gaussian. Binomial, \\u03c72 and Poisson, among others, are other statistical distributions that the readers are already familiar with or at least, have heard of; but what of data mining and machine learning? Data mining and machine learning can be defined in many ways. Here, the authors describe data mining as a set of techniques for analysing and describing structured data; and machine learning as one for interpreting data by comparing them to models for data behaviour. In essence, data mining and machine learning are about looking for patterns and relationships in data. Perhaps an easier way to look at it is through the readers\\u2019 own experience with supermarket and social media. By means of the bonus-point programme, supermarket accumulates customers\\u2019 shopping habits and interests. Ever notice when the readers stop buying something, say a dog food, after a while there are emails (or snail mails even) of the same enticing the readers to go and buy one (Sales now on! etc., never mind that the dog has been put to sleep)? That is all data mining, popular with the customer relationship management team. Or, any kind of News Feed the readers get on Facebook? How does Facebook know the readers want to see the video of the cat first thing in the morning? Facebook algorithm essentially learns (yes, on its own) via statistical analysis what the readers like (and \\u2018Like\\u2019) and bingo! The cat\\u2019s Feed is at the top. The fact that the algorithm can do this without being told is machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence. What is this book about? One half of this book is about statistics. The other is about using statistics in astronomy and astrophysics. As the readers already know, scientists, astronomers included, are not clueless when it comes to statistics \\u2013 they have been using it for ages. If that is so, why do they need this book then? The truth is, the field of statistics has evolved by leaps and bounds, leaving astronomers stuck in the same old rut, using the same old technique that is proven to be more and more cumbersome each day in dealing with the amount of data that easily run to the terabytes. (It seems astronomers no longer count data by the numbers but by (computer) memory instead.) In a word, the book is about teaching astronomers the art of analysing very large data-sets by introducing a more efficient way of using statistics. It is a practical guide to data mining by utilising tools such as unsupervised classification, clustering, principal component analysis, locally linear embedding and the somewhat exotic-sounding, projection pursuit; and to machine learning by methods like Bayesian, supervised classification, maximum likelihood estimator and regression. (Supervised simply means something about the data is already known while unsupervised means nothing is.) The combination of the three subjects is certainly special as usually, the readers would have to get different text(s) for each. The way to read this book is by doing i.e. by practicing the computer codes to reproduce the graphs and figures as the readers go through it so the pros and cons of any particular method can be studied. To make the practice accessible to all, the authors have used AstroML1 based on Python2 in their sample analyses. Python is an open-source object-oriented language that is quickly gaining popularity in the scientific community not least because it is free hence available to everybody; and AstroML is its module for data mining and machine learning. Nothing needs to be done other than installing Python and the AstroML package to start the ball rolling. For the purpose of this book, data-sets from Sloan Digital Sky Survey are used. There is no need to worry about their large volume either as the data are maintained on GitHub,3 the online repository. Of course, the readers can also choose to use their own data and modify the codes as they see fit. Who is this book for? Obviously it is written for those already in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics that collect data by the millions like extragalactic astronomy, exoplanets, etc. Its value can only be appreciated by researches looking for ways of interpreting the astronomical amount of astronomical data (OK, pun intended) by way of statistics.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"b78888bc9dd18a1a8c36bb560ca18f9b1eeab05e\", \"abstract\": \"Welcome to this inaugural issue of Radiology: Artificial Intelligence. Our journal\\u2019s mission is to publish highquality scientific work that advances our understanding of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology. AI has become a topic of great interest\\u2014especially the application of machine learning techniques to medical images\\u2014but AI itself is not new. The term artificial intelligence was proposed in 1956 to describe efforts to understand, simulate, and improve upon human qualities such as reasoning, learning, solving problems, understanding verbal and written language, processing visual information, and playing games like chess and poker. What is new is a resurgence of interest in AI, particularly in the use of machine learning to recognize patterns in images. And, curiously, it is game playing that has opened this new frontier\\u2014but not the games of chess, checkers, or Go. Rather, think Xbox and PlayStation. Video games require a rapidly changing three-dimensional scene to be transformed into two-dimensional images shown in real time. The need to compute images efficiently spurred the development of highly parallelized graphics processing units. These specialized processors, in turn, have powered software for increasingly complex and sophisticated \\u201cdeep\\u201d artificial neural network models. Whereas neural networks developed 10 years ago typically had three or four layers, today\\u2019s deep networks comprise hundreds of layers (1). Deep learning models have engendered both great excitement and a great deal of hyperbole. After all, if AI systems can pick out pictures of cats on the web, then surely such systems are ready to replace radiologists, right? Well, perhaps not, at least not right now. There is much work to be done to build and validate systems that can detect and characterize the thousands of imaging findings and their associated diseases that can be seen across a panoply of radiology studies. And that brings us to the quote from Shakespeare. Anyone can claim to build an AI system, but that doesn\\u2019t mean that the system will do their bidding as imagined. Our journal is here to assure that the science and applications of AI in radiology are built on thoughtful, innovative, and well-validated research. What sorts of topics will this journal publish? We will bring you the same high caliber of research that is found in RSNA\\u2019s flagship scientific journal, Radiology, but focused here on AI, machine learning, and data science in radiology. In particular, we seek to publish first-rate work that provides rigorous evaluation of AI\\u2019s applications to clinical problems in radiology. We invite manuscripts that show the impact of AI to extract information, diagnose and manage disease in patients, streamline radiology workflow, or improve health care outcomes. We\\u2019re interested in image segmentation, image reconstruction, automated detection of abnormalities, diagnostic reasoning, natural language processing, clinical workflow analysis, radiomics, and radiogenomics. We also invite manuscripts that demonstrate novel applications of AI in radiology or highlight innovative AI methodologies. Developers of publicly available sets of radiologic images, image annotations, radiology reports, or algorithms can present their work as a Data Resources report. AI and radiology do not exist in isolation: they are part of broad endeavors to advance knowledge and improve health. As such, this journal will feature articles on the ethical, legal, social, and economic implications of AI in radiology. AI is and must be a human\\u2014and humane\\u2014activity (2). We must engage in this work with an eye to how these technologies will help us care for our patients more effectively and humanely. Our goal is not to replace, but rather to extend our human abilities to provide medical care\\u2014 and to improve the lives of those we are privileged to serve.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms are becoming hot topics in systems medicine and emerging OMICS fields such as microbiome science. Therefore, please allow me to introduce the journal readership to you. OMICS is the first systems sciences and systems thinking journal with a legacy over two decades. Our approach to large-scale biology is interdisciplinary and integrative. With that, I mean an approach that is broadly focused on systems science technologies, interdisciplinary, and spans from \\u2018\\u2018cell to society.\\u2019\\u2019 Let\\u2019s start with a brief history of AI from 20th century. Have AI and its conception changed since the last century? Mr. Colin Garvey: An easy way to make sense of AI history is in terms of three paradigms, \\u2018\\u2018GOFAI\\u2019\\u2019 (1950\\u201360s), \\u2018\\u2018expert systems\\u2019\\u2019 (late 1970\\u201380s), and \\u2018\\u2018machine learning\\u2019\\u2019 (2010\\u2013present). GOFAI, short for \\u2018\\u2018good old-fashioned artificial intelligence,\\u2019\\u2019 employed symbolic logic to make \\u2018\\u2018thinking machines,\\u2019\\u2019 which basically failed. But the basic insight that clever heuristics were more important than bruteforce computation for intelligent behavior in machines lived on. Some say heuristic search, which is still used billions of times a day on the Internet, was the original AI problem. Next, the expert systems paradigm still used symbolic logic but narrowed the focus from general intelligence to human expertise in specific domains, such as chemistry and medicine. Attempts to replicate experts\\u2019 knowledge and decision-making processes led to the first major medical AI system, MYCIN, and eventually to more familiar software like TurboTax. But the expert systems paradigm has always been limited by the \\u2018\\u2018knowledge acquisition bottleneck\\u2019\\u2019\\u2014 it turns out that extracting expertise from living humans is hard, time-consuming work! The current machine learning (ML) paradigm bypasses that bottleneck to extrapolate patterns or \\u2018\\u2018learn\\u2019\\u2019 directly from data, usually through a training period of 100,000s of trial-and-error loops. This requires considerable computational power and memory, which is why the recent successes of ML algorithms in image and speech recognition, language translation, and games like Go and poker, owe as much to recent hardware innovations as clever programming. That said, ML doesn\\u2019t seem to be taking AI any closer to the longtime dream of \\u2018\\u2018general intelligence.\\u2019\\u2019 In many cases ML even makes AI less intelligible to humans. Most ML algorithms, once fully trained on a given dataset, become what you might call \\u2018\\u2018black box savants\\u2019\\u2019: accurate 98% of the time, but totally incapable of explaining why they produce the answers they do. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) recently launched the \\u2018\\u2018Explainable AI\\u2019\\u2019 program specifically to address this problem. Prof. \\u00d6zdemir: AI and related tools are rapidly changing engineering, manufacturing, and industry practices. Yet, AI has not been firmly at the epicenter of medical research and life sciences compared to engineering, self-driving cars, or customer and retail services. AI might potentially be harnessed with a view to systems medicine, for example, to obtain and make sense of deep phenotypic data collected in the course of a day in community settings (instead of hospital settings) on individuals\\u2019 health. What are the key prospects that AI offers for medical research? Mr. Garvey: With the proliferation of cheap computation and data storage, high-bandwidth wireless connections, and sensors in smartphones and wearables, the infrastructure for continuous monitoring of more life processes at finer scales now exists, and the data produced thereby offer great potential in the ML paradigm. Informed by a systems perspective of the organism-in-context, AI could help to facilitate a transformation in medicine, away from the treatment of symptoms by specialists to the intergenerational maintenance and enhancement of health at individual, community, and even population levels. Of course, the promise of gathering data across the entire phenotypic expression of the human organism raises a number of serious ethical questions\\u2014but this is an area where I think the medical community has greater expertise than the technologists. For this reason, systems medicine can and should inform the development of relevant AI technologies. Prof. \\u00d6zdemir: What about the AI prospects for clinical applications? Any linkages between AI and the quantified self movement? Mr. Garvey: One positive example I like is the electronic wristband developed by Rosalind Picard of MIT\\u2019s Media Lab. It uses AI to predict epileptic seizures in the wearer by analyzing sensor data gathered via sensor contact with the skin, to prevent dangerous falls and other risks.

In diagnostic imaging, nuclear medicine physicians communicate with referring physicians to establish indications for imaging studies, perform or supervise imaging procedures to obtain high-quality images, interpret images to compile medical reports, and communicate results to inform patients and their referring doctors. In many of these tasks, computers already are indispensable tools that enable or assist the work of physicians. How does artificial intelligence (AI) fit into this workflow (Fig. 1)? There is no universal definition of AI (1), but in the context of practical applications, AI can be considered a scientific discipline that uses computers to perform tasks usually requiring human cognition. Research topics on AI include pattern recognition, natural language processing, machine learning, problem solving, and knowledge representation. Thus, AI techniques apply to many core competencies in metabolic imaging and nuclear medicine, and this has led to an enormous interest and even hype about AI in medical imaging (2). AI applications at present dominate the technical exhibitions of international imaging conferences such as the 2019 European Congress of Radiology (https://ecronline.myesr.org/ecr2019/) and are prominently featured in the product portfolios of most commercial companies of medical imaging technology. AI applications have enabled a multibillion-dollar business model for the large Internet companies penetrating the consumer market in many ways, including Internet searches, social networks, or smartphone software. In consumer markets, value is measured by the willingness of a consumer to use or pay for a product. Therefore, the value of AI applications in consumer markets depends not on an intrinsic objective value but the perception of the customer. This value concept is well illustrated by a quote attributed to Charles Revson, the founder of a cosmetics company: \\u2018\\u2018In the factory we make cosmetics, in the store we sell hope.\\u2019\\u2019 However, in medicine the business model and the value concept of a consumer market do not apply. Hope is essential when taking care of patients, but hope cannot serve as the foundation for medical decision making and patient stratification. Several decades ago, patients with extrasystoles after a myocardial infarction were commonly treated with antiarrhythmic drugs in the hope of preventing arrhythmic death. A large, randomized multicenter trial uncovered this hope as a deadly illusion and established that the antiarrhythmic therapy in fact increased arrhythmic mortality and caused premature death in thousands of patients. From this trial and others that were able to scientifically disprove suggested or assumed benefits based on hope and hype, rigorous and often laborious scientific methods have emerged that permit establishing, grading, or disproving the value of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. For patients, value is generated if quality of life is improved, morbidity is reduced, or preventable mortality is eliminated. It is difficult or impossible for both patients and physicians to directly assess the value of medical products, interventions, or technology. Thus, science is essential to firmly guide patient care. International guidelines compiled by professional societies assess the value of diagnostic and therapeutic methods based on scientific evidence and, for each method, clearly state the class of recommendation for a particular use with an associated level of evidence. This science-based model of grading value for patient care has been universally adopted in the medical community. Currently, there is little scientific evidence for the value of AI applications in medical imaging. Several AI applications have received Food and Drug Administration approval (3), but this does not imply that AI applications at present are relevant for medical practice or that their value has been firmly established. Most AI applications are built from 3 essential components: complex computer algorithms, extensive computing resources, and large data sets. Algorithms and computing facilities are easily available at little or no cost. Many powerful AI algorithms are published as opensource code, such as TensorFlow (https://www.tensorflow.org) and Core ML (https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/). Extensive computing power is offered instantaneously on demand through the large Internet companies. Recently, even smartphones have been equipped with high-power computing hardware, including neural network chips that enable intensive AI applications, such as facial identification or speech recognition. In contrast, large data sets are more difficult to collect and thus are the most critical component when building AI applications. Data are more important than hardware or software in determining the success of AI applications (4). Even highly complex AI algorithms cannot compensate for incomplete, inadequate, or low-quality data collection. Thus, the characteristics and validity of data sets need to be firmly established and made fully transparent when AI applications are investigated for a proposed clinical purpose. Collaborative efforts are frequently required to compile the large data sets, which need to include many thousands of data entries. Recently, the Mozilla Common Voice project (https://voice. mozilla.org/en) has published an open-source multilanguage data set of voice recordings from 40,000 people in 18 languages to foster and enable research in natural language processing.

THE POPULARITY OF ML techniques has increased in recent years. ML is used in many domains, including cyber security, IoT, and autonomous cars. ML techniques rely on mathematics and software engineering. The former generates algorithms, develops capabilities to learn from input data, and produces representative models. The latter is employed for implementation and performance. Although many works investigated the mathematics and computer science on which ML techniques are built, few have examined their implementation. This situation raises many concerns. The first is software complexity of ML techniques. The second is quality of the available implementations, including performance and reliability. The third is model quality, which may be negatively impacted by software bug. These concerns could be alleviated if developers could demonstrate the software quality of their implementations. Consequently, researchers and practitioners have been studying best practices to design ML application systems to address issues with software complexity and quality of ML techniques. Such practices are often formalized as architecture patterns and design patterns. These patterns encapsulate reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems within ML application systems and software design.

While impressive progress in this area has been reported, most of the reported successes are applications of artificial intelligence in Western medicine. The application of artificial intelligence in traditional Chinese medicine has lagged mainly because traditional Chinese medicine practitioners need to perform syndrome differentiation as well as biomedical disease diagnosis before a treatment decision can be made. Syndrome, a concept unique to traditional Chinese medicine, is an abstraction of a variety of signs and symptoms. The fact that the relationship between diseases and syndromes is not one-to-one but rather many-to-many makes it very challenging for a machine to perform syndrome predictions. So far, only a handful of artificial intelligence\\u2013based assistive traditional Chinese medicine diagnostic models have been reported, and they are limited in application to a single disease-type. Objective The objective was to develop an artificial intelligence\\u2013based assistive diagnostic system capable of diagnosing multiple types of diseases that are common in traditional Chinese medicine, given a patient\\u2019s electronic health record notes. The system was designed to simultaneously diagnose the disease and produce a list of corresponding syndromes. Methods Unstructured freestyle electronic health record notes were processed by natural language processing techniques to extract clinical information such as signs and symptoms which were represented by named entities. Natural language processing used a recurrent neural network model called bidirectional long short-term memory network\\u2013conditional random forest. A convolutional neural network was then used to predict the disease-type out of 187 diseases in traditional Chinese medicine. A novel traditional Chinese medicine syndrome prediction method\\u2014an integrated learning model\\u2014was used to produce a corresponding list of probable syndromes. By following a majority-rule voting method, the integrated learning model for syndrome prediction can take advantage of four existing prediction methods (back propagation, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and support vector classifier) while avoiding their respective weaknesses which resulted in a consistently high prediction accuracy. Results A data set consisting of 22,984 electronic health records from Guanganmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences that were collected between January 1, 2017 and September 7, 2018 was used. The data set contained a total of 187 diseases that are commonly diagnosed in traditional Chinese medicine. The diagnostic system was designed to be able to detect any one of the 187 disease-types. The data set was partitioned into a training set, a validation set, and a testing set in a ratio of 8:1:1. Test results suggested that the proposed system had a good diagnostic accuracy and a strong capability for generalization. The disease-type prediction accuracies of the top one, top three, and top five were 80.5%, 91.6%, and 94.2%, respectively. Conclusions The main contributions of the artificial intelligence\\u2013based traditional Chinese medicine assistive diagnostic system proposed in this paper are that 187 commonly known traditional Chinese medicine diseases can be diagnosed and a novel prediction method called an integrated learning model is demonstrated. This new prediction method outperformed all four existing methods in our preliminary experimental results. With further improvement of the algorithms and the availability of additional electronic health record data, it is expected that a wider range of traditional Chinese medicine disease-types could be diagnosed and that better diagnostic accuracies could be achieved.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"21412d1d0a8db97fa04e7ff44c65c44f89fa0680\", \"abstract\": \"Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning are entering the mainstream of clinical medicine. For example, in December 2016, Gulshan et al1 reported development and validation of a deep learning algorithm for detection of diabetic retinopathy in retinal fundus photographs. An accompanying editorial by Wong and Bressler2 pointed out limits of the study, the need for further validation of the algorithm in different populations, and unresolved challenges (eg, incorporating the algorithm into clinical work flows and convincing clinicians and patients to \\u201ctrust a \\u2018black box\\u2019\\u201d). Sixteen months later, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)3 permitted marketing of the first medical device to use AI to detect diabetic retinopathy. FDA reduced the risk of releasing the device by limiting the indication for use to screening adults who do not have visual symptoms for greater than mild retinopathy, to refer them to an eye care specialist. This issue of JAMA contains 2 Viewpoints on deep learning in health care. Hinton4 explains the technology underlying AI and deep learning, using clinical examples. AI is the general term for imitating human intelligence with computer systems. Early AI systems represented human reasoning with symbolic logic. As computer processing and storage became more powerful, researchers developed machine-learning techniques to imitate the way the human brain learns. The first machine learning continued to rely on human experts to label the data the system trained on (eg, the diagnosis) and to identify the significant features (eg, findings). Machine learning weighted the features from the data. With continued advances in computational power and with larger data sets, researchers began to develop deep learning techniques. The first deep learning algorithms were \\u201csupervised\\u201d in that human experts continued to label the training data, and the deep learning algorithms learned the features and weights directly from the data. The retinopathy screening algorithms are an example of supervised deep learning. Hinton4 describes continuing development of new deep learning techniques, including ones that are completely unsupervised. He also points out that it is not feasible to see the features learned by deep learning to explain how the system reaches a conclusion. Naylor5 identifies 7 factors driving adoption of AI and deep learning in health care: (1) the strengths of digital imaging over human interpretation; (2) the digitization of health-related records and data sharing; (3) the adaptability of deep learning to analysis of heterogeneous data sets; (4) the capacity of deep learning for hypothesis generation in research; (5) the promise of deep learning to streamline clinical workflows and empower patients; (6) the rapid-diffusion open-source and proprietary deep learning programs; and (7) of the adequacy of today\\u2019s basic deep learning technology to deliver improved performance as data sets get larger. Factors 3, 4, and 6 are specific to deep learning; the other factors apply to other AI techniques as well. Artificial intelligence is a family of technical techniques in the same way the radiologic imaging tool kit includes flat images, computed tomography scans, and functional imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging. Advances in computational technology, computer science, informatics, and statistics improve existing techniques and make new techniques possible. The addition of deep learning to the AI family of techniques represents an advance similar in magnitude to the addition of the computed tomography scanner to the radiology tool kit. Each AI technique has strengths and weaknesses. Symbolic logic is self-explaining but difficult to scale.6 For example, knowledge engineers extract the logic by interviewing or observing human experts. Statistical techniques such as supervised deep learning scale, but are subject to bias in the training data, and the reasoning cannot be explained. Since deep learning systems are trained on data from the past, they are not prepared to reason in the way humans do about conditions that have not been seen before. In the future, unsupervised deep learning may reduce this gap between human intelligence and AI. The potential applications of AI in health care present a range of computational difficulty. Narrow tasks, in which the context is predefined, are relatively easy. Imageprocessing tasks such as recognizing the border of an organ to suggest where to cut off a scan, or highlighting a suspicious area in an image for the radiologist or pathologist, are examples of narrow tasks. Image analysis and diagnostic prediction tasks such as the diabetic retinopathy example are broader and harder, but doable with today\\u2019s technology. Very broad data analysis and pattern prediction tasks such as analyzing heterogeneous data sets from diverse sources to suggest novel associations are feasible today because the purpose is limited to hypothesis generation. Thinking in the way humans do\\u2014reasoning, for example, from a few observations to suggest a novel scientific framework as Einstein did with the theory of relativity\\u2014is beyond technology on the horizon. Clinicians should view the output of AI programs or devices as statistical predictions.

Pretty unremarkable, right? Maybe, but in the few hours that you have been awake you have most likely interacted with numerous instances of machine learning algorithms ticking away just below the surface of our everyday lives. The term \\u201cmachine learning\\u201d may be defined as algorithms that allow computers to learn to perform tasks, identify relationships, and discern patterns without the need for humans to provide the underlying instructions. Conventional algorithms operate by sequentially executing a preprogrammed set of rules to achieve a particular outcome. Machine learning algorithms, by contrast, are instead provided with a set of examples by the user and train themselves to learn the rules f rom the data. This powerful idea dates back to at least the 1950s, but has only been fully realized in recent years with the advent of sufficiently large digital data sets over which to perform training\\ue0d5for example, Google photo albums, Amazon shopping lists, Netflix viewing histories\\ue0d5and sufficiently powerful computer hardware and algorithms to perform the training\\ue0d5typically powerful graphics cards developed for the computer game industry that can be hijacked to conduct machine learning. This paradigm has revolutionized multiple domains of science and technology, with different variants of machine learning dominating, and in some cases enabling, multifarious applications such as retail recommendation engines, facial detection and recognition, language translation, autonomous and assisted driving, spam filtering, and character recognition. The success of these algorithms may be largely attributed to their enormous flexibility and power to extract patterns, correlations, and structure from data. These features can be nonintuitive and complicated functions that are difficult for humans to parse, or exist as weak signals that are only discernible from large, high-dimensional data sets that defy conventional analysis techniques. There remains a fundamental difference between artificial and human intelligence\\ue0d5no machine has yet exhibited generic human cognition, and for now, the Turing Test remains intact1\\ue0d5but machine performance in certain specific tasks is unequivocally superhuman. A prominent example is provided by Google\\u2019s Go-playing computer program AlphaGo Zero. This program was provided only with the rules of the ancient board game and learned to play by playing games against itself in a form of reinforcement learning. After just 3 days of training, AlphaGo Zero roundly defeated the best previous best algorithm (AlphaGo Lee) that had itself beaten the 18-time (human) world champion Lee Sedol 100 games to 0. Remarkably, AlphaGo Zero employed previously unknown strategies of play that had never been discovered by human players over the 2500 year history of the game.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"b68763eba5dfce131d089a446e9e4ebd1dd89a7c\", \"abstract\": \"Machine learning is a sub field of artificial intelligence which allows forecasting through learning past behaviors and rules from old data.

Objective We intended to identify and evaluate published studies that have tested or implemented AI in CBPHC settings. Methods We conducted a systematic scoping review informed by an earlier study and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review framework and reported the findings according to PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis-Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. An information specialist performed a comprehensive search from the date of inception until February 2020, in seven bibliographic databases: Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore. The selected studies considered all populations who provide and receive care in CBPHC settings, AI interventions that had been implemented, tested, or both, and assessed outcomes related to patients, health care providers, or CBPHC systems. Risk of bias was assessed using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).

Such a consortium heralds that academic, economic, and sociological innovation/transformation would ensue sequentially and concurrently. Dare we dream how far science can go? The impact of these changes has not yet affected our everyday lives because these technological advances have not yet become an essential part of our lives. However, Virtual Reality (VR) developers are already almost finished constructing a real economy in several VR platforms (Park, 2018c). The AI-driven Autonomous Driving Car (ADC) is also expected to be released in 2020 (Business-Insider, 2016). By extension, Google\\u2019s Toronto smart city project will initiate its pilot program this summer, begin construction in 2020, and have its first residents by 2022 (Li, 2018). A drastic socio-structural change in our lives is already underway (Park, 2018c).\\u00a0 Each academic discipline is accordingly transitioning to a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics)-integrated education policy and reforming the curriculum to meet the demands of the times. Such an attempt mainly focuses on providing students a wide array of methodological expertise and hands-on experience in data science through taking additional courses delivered by STEM-related departments, upon students\\u2019 request. The course content includes combining large data sets with advanced analytics, e.g., (1) data/text/opinion/reality mining, (2) descriptive statistical analytics such as data visualization, social network analysis and cluster analysis, and (3) predictive analytics such as mathematical modeling, forecasting, simulation, machine learning, and so on (O\\u2019Connor, 2018). However, we must face an inconvenient truth about students\\u2019 preparation in statistics and mathematics, the foundational subjects of data science. Above all, before teaching students computer programming with Python or R, we first need to figure out WHAT the students want to mine from the flood of data. We also need to proactively identify whether the students understand HOW to explore their intellectual curiosity. That is, a well-established pre-knowledge about the primary specialization encompassing statistics and/or mathematics is required. For example, a decision science expert whose primary major is not nursing science has inherent limits performing data analyses appropriately reflecting the nature and value of nursing care. His/her evidence may be ineffective or even dangerous to nursing practice. No matter how perfect its scientific integrity is, knowledge without a foundation in the primary science may result in invalid policy-making in nursing practice (Park, 2018b), consequently threatening patient safety. Data science requires a totally different way of thinking and working from traditional, fixed framework-oriented, statistics-based nursing science (O\\u2019Connor, 2018; Park, 2018b), indicating that creativity and originality are highly valued in the new era of science. However, most undergraduate and even graduate nursing programs do not currently have an educational system synthesizing mathematics and computer programming such as Python or R, even though statistics is relatively well-integrated in curriculums. First, a lack of competent educators in both nursing science and data science is an urgent issue. However, insufficiency of scholarly preparation in mathematics among current nurse scientists is more urgent (Park, 2017), setting back the advancement of nursing science and going against the trend. An enormous challenge lies ahead due to the demanding nature of mathematics, with its long, high-intensity training and the wide gap between/among the viewpoints of academic disciplines\\u2014i.e., the humanities/social sciences and STEM. However, we should no longer avoid such a challenge. We nurses have an obligation to keep on doing our best to satisfy the ever-changing and complex needs of our patients in order to protect them from potential harm as well as enhance patients\\u2019 well-being.

In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can solve even complex cases and provide diagnoses within short time frames with a level of accuracy that occasionally surpasses the capabilities of radiologists. In this vein, data scientists and data engineers have appeared before radiology society conferences and delivered interesting talks regarding AI. As a result of the use of AI in radiology, previously unheard-of terminology has been introduced to the field that will become common language in the near future. Thus, this paper seeks to define many of these common terms for the benefit of radiology practitioners. In their Canadian Association of Radiologists white paper on AI, Tang et al. very briefly mentioned an AI glossary (2). However, to the best of this author\\u2019s knowledge, this paper presents the first brief, practical glossary for AI in radiology in the English literature that can serve as a reference prototype for the purpose of simplifying the complex terminology. It is especially designed for radiology trainees and experienced radiologists who have an interest in AI. It is important to note that this is not intended as a precise or exhaustive glossary; therefore, some data science-specific, nonradiological terminology has been excluded from this paper. Instead, the most frequently encountered terms that relate to radiology are included below. Artificial intelligence (AI): Highly developed computer systems that have the ability to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, translation, speech recognition, image interpretation, interaction with humans (e.g. chatting), and decision-making. AI, sometimes called machine intelligence, is a type of intelligence demonstrated by machines (3,4). Algorithm: Step-by-step instructions completed by computers, including simple or complex tasks, such as setting reminders or identifying a group of people within a crowd (4). Backpropagation: The manner in which CNNs learn. They are able to recognize the differences between output and desired output and adjust calculations in reverse order of execution (5). Big data: A term for extremely large datasets that can be analyzed to reveal patterns, trends, and associations. Big data includes electronic medical records, which contain huge digital imaging archives, pathology department and laboratory archives, and millions of digital clinical notes and diagnoses (4). Blackbox: CNN\\u2019s (algorithm\\u2019s) unknown internal working pattern (6). Essentially unknown processing, especially within hidden layers. For example, it is difficult to comprehend how a CNN reaches an outcome. Cluster analysis (clustering): The task of grouping a set of objects similar to each other into clusters (7). Convolutional neural network (CNN): Deep learning intelligence network commonly used in diagnostic imaging (7). Data mining: A process used to extract usable data from a larger set of raw data. Data mining algorithms are particularly beneficial on complex datasets with a large number of variables and samples (8). Data science: A field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured. Similar to data mining (7). Data scientist: A person who analyzes and interprets data (9). Deep learning (machine learning): \\u201cA set of automatic pattern recognition methods that have been successfully applied across various problem domains, including biomedical image analysis\\u201d (10). Diagnosis (artificial intelligence): Concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to show whether the behavior of an AI system is correct\"}, {\"paperId\": \"d4a9f5dd8a13fb5d193e16c8877e5c2244d5ab82\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"e95f3a8b8b7b7f73b17296da8f41da7ffd8cf4a4\", \"abstract\": \"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare delivery has become an important area of research due to the rapid progression of technology, which has allowed the growth of many processes historically reliant upon human input. AI has become particularly important in plastic surgery in a variety of settings. This article highlights current applications of AI in plastic surgery and discusses future implications. We further detail ethical issues that may arise in the implementation of AI in plastic surgery. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of all electronically available publications in the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases as of February 5, 2020. All returned publications regarding the application of AI in plastic surgery were considered for inclusion. Results: Of the 89 novel articles returned, 14 satisfied inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles procured from the references of those of the database search and those pertaining to historical and ethical implications were summarized when relevant. Conclusions: Numerous applications of AI exist in plastic surgery. Big data, machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and facial recognition are examples of AI-based technology that plastic surgeons may utilize to advance their surgical practice. Like any evolving technology, however, the use of AI in healthcare raises important ethical issues, including patient autonomy and informed consent, confidentiality, and appropriate data use.

The aim of this study was to develop an objective predictive model using machine learning modeling to assess the intensity levels of sensory descriptors in beer using the physical measurements of color and foam-related parameters. A robotic pourer (RoboBEER), was used to obtain 15 color and foam-related parameters from 22 different commercial beer samples. A sensory session using quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA\\u00ae ) with trained panelists was conducted to assess the intensity of 10 beer descriptors. Results showed that the principal component analysis explained 64% of data variability with correlations found between foam-related descriptors from sensory and RoboBEER such as the positive and significant correlation between carbon dioxide and carbonation mouthfeel (R = 0.62), correlation of viscosity to sensory, and maximum volume of foam and total lifetime of foam (R = 0.75, R = 0.77, respectively). Using the RoboBEER parameters as inputs, an artificial neural network (ANN) regression model showed high correlation (R = 0.91) to predict the intensity levels of 10 related sensory descriptors such as yeast, grains and hops aromas, hops flavor, bitter, sour and sweet tastes, viscosity, carbonation, and astringency.\\n\\n\\nPRACTICAL APPLICATIONS\\nThis paper is a novel approach for food science using machine modeling techniques that could contribute significantly to rapid screenings of food and brewage products for the food industry and the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

When the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act was passed, policy makers believed that EHRs would lead to care that was more efficient, effective, and equitable,15 and EHRs have led to important advances in population health and quality.16 However, with increasing burnout and decreasing time with patients, many lament that EHRs cater to the needs of administrators and EHR vendors rather than physicians and patients.17 The usability and interoperability failures underlying these complaints are not the result of gaps in technological expertise. Instead, these failures emerged, in part, because end-users like ourselves have been insufficiently engaged in relevant design, policy, and implementation decisions. As AI spreads, our participation is needed to shape this revolution. Without our patient-centered orientation, AI has focused on delivering value to shareholders of technology companies rather than on problems that affect patients in our practices. Without our focus on value, AI has escalated health care costs and is available only to those with resources rather than those who would benefit the most. Without our focus on personal relationships, AI has further eroded face time by increasing the amount of time we spend interacting with computers. Without the breadth of our patients, AI has magnified existing biases.

This book is a textbook for a first course in data science. No previous knowledge of R is necessary, although some experience with programming may be helpful. The book is divided into six parts: R, data visualization, statistics with R, data wrangling, machine learning, and productivity tools. Each part has several chapters meant to be presented as one lecture. The author uses motivating case studies that realistically mimic a data scientist\\u2019s experience. He starts by asking specific questions and answers these through data analysis so concepts are learned as a means to answering the questions. Examples of the case studies included are: US murder rates by state, self-reported student heights, trends in world health and economics, the impact of vaccines on infectious disease rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, election forecasting, building a baseball team, image processing of hand-written digits, and movie recommendation systems. The statistical concepts used to answer the case study questions are only briefly introduced, so complementing with a probability and statistics textbook is highly recommended for in-depth understanding of these concepts. If you read and understand the chapters and complete the exercises, you will be prepared to learn the more advanced concepts and skills needed to become an expert. The statistics profession is at a unique point in history. The need for valid statistical tools is greater than ever; data sets are massive, often measuring hundreds of thousands of measurements for a single subject. The field is ready to move towards clear objective benchmarks under which tools can be evaluated. Targeted learning allows (1) the full generalization and utilization of cross-validation as an estimator selection tool so that the subjective choices made by humans are now made by the machine, and (2) targeting the fitting of the probability distribution of the data toward the target parameter representing the scientific question of interest. This book is aimed at both statisticians and applied researchers interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational and experimental data. Part I is an accessible introduction to super learning and the targeted maximum likelihood estimator, including related concepts necessary to understand and apply these methods. Parts II-IX handle complex data structures and topics applied researchers will immediately recognize from their own research, including time-to-event outcomes, direct and indirect effects, positivity violations, case-control studies, and algorithmic foundations of data science, including machine learning, high-dimensional geometry, and analysis of large networks. Topics include the counterintuitive nature of data in high dimensions, important linear algebraic techniques such as singular value decomposition, the theory of random walks and Markov chains, the fundamentals of and important algorithms for machine learning, algorithms and analysis for clustering, probabilistic models for large networks, representation learning including topic modelling and non-negative matrix factorization, wavelets and compressed sensing. Important probabilistic techniques are developed including the law of large numbers, tail inequalities, analysis of random projections, generalization guarantees in machine learning, and moment methods for analysis of phase transitions in large random graphs. Additionally, important structural and complexity measures are discussed such as matrix norms and VC-dimension. This book is suitable for both undergraduate and graduate courses in the design and analysis of algorithms for data. As telescopes, detectors, and computers grow ever more powerful, the volume of data at the disposal of astronomers and astrophysicists will enter the petabyte domain, providing accurate measurements for billions of celestial objects. This book provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the cutting-edge statistical methods needed to efficiently analyze complex data sets from astronomical surveys such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, the Dark Energy Survey, and the upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. It serves as a practical handbook for graduate students and advanced undergraduates in physics and astronomy, and as an indispensable reference for researchers. Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy presents a wealth of practical analysis problems, evaluates techniques for solving them, and explains how to use various approaches for different types and sizes of data sets. For all applications described in the book, Python code and example data sets are provided. The supporting data sets have been carefully selected from contemporary astronomical surveys (for example, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey) and are easy to download and use.

In contrast, clinical care has yet to reach the much lower bar of automating health care information transactions in the form of electronic health records. Medical leaders in the 1960s and 1970s were already speculating about the opportunities to bring automated inference methods to patient care,1 but the methods and data had not yet reached the critical mass needed to achieve those goals. The intellectual roots of \\u201cdeep learning,\\u201d which power the commodity and consumer implementations of presentday artificial intelligence, were planted even earlier in the 1940s and 1950s with the development of \\u201cartificial neural network\\u201d algorithms.2,3 These algorithms, as their name suggests, are very loosely based on the way in which the brain\\u2019s web of neurons adaptively becomes rewired in response to external stimuli to perform learning and pattern recognition. Even though these methods have had many success stories over the past 70 years, their performance and adoption in medicine in the past 5 years has seen a quantum leap. The catalyzing event occurred in 2012 when a team of researchers from the University of Toronto reduced the error rate in half on a well-known computer vision challenge using a deep learning algorithm.4 This work rapidly accelerated research and development in deep learning and propelled the field forward at a staggering pace. With the increased availability of digital clinical data, it remains to be seen how these deep learning models might be applied to the medical domain. In this issue of JAMA, Gulshan and colleagues5 present findings from a study evaluating the use of deep learning for detection of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. To build their model, the authors collected 128 175 annotated images from the EyePACs database. Each image was rated by 3 to 7 clinicians for referable diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and overall image quality. Each rater was selected from a panel of 54 board-certified ophthalmologists and senior ophthalmology residents. Using this data set, the algorithm learned to predict the consensus grade of the raters along each clinical attribute: referable diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and image quality. To validate their algorithm, the authors assessed its performance on 2 separate and nonoverlapping data sets consisting of 9963 and 1748 images. On the validation data, the algorithm had high sensitivity and specificity. Only one of these values (sensitivity on the second validation data set) failed to be superior at a statistically significant level. The other performance metrics (eg, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, negative predictive value, positive predictive value) were likewise impressive, giving the authors confidence that this algorithm could be of clinical utility. This work closely mirrors a recent \\u201cKaggle\\u201d contest in which 661 teams competed to build an algorithm to predict the grade of diabetic retinopathy, albeit on a smaller data set with fewer grades per image. Kaggle is a website that hosts machine learning and data science contests. Companies and researchers can post their data to Kaggle and have contestants from around the world build predictive models. In the diabetic retinopathy contest, nearly all of the top teams used some form of deep learning and had little to no knowledge of the eye or ophthalmology. The first-place team6 and secondplace team7 both used standard deep learning models and were data science practitioners, not medical professionals. Gulshan et al correctly pointed out that a prerequisite for a successful deep learning model is access to a large database of images with high-quality annotations. Accordingly, the investigators increased both the number of images available and the number of ratings per image, which allowed them to improve on the existing state of the art with respect to both Kaggle and the existing scientific literature. To build their algorithm, Gulshan et al leveraged a workhorse model in deep learning known as a convolutional neural network that has been critically important to recent advances in automatic image recognition. The convolutional neural network model used by the authors is known as the Inception-V3 network,8 which was developed by Google for entry in the Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, which it won in 2014. In this contest, known as ImageNet,9 researchers were given 1.2 million images that involve 1000 different categories that cover a wide variety of everyday objects, such as cats, dogs, automobiles, and different kinds of food. The goal of the contest was to build a classifier that could automatically recognize which object was present in an image and to identify which region of the image contained the object. This challenge was broad so that it covered many types of objects that a computer vision system could encounter in the real world. As a result of this contest, several techniques10-12 have been pioneered that improved the accuracy of these models immensely. As with the study by Gulshan et al, these improvements are beginning to trickle into other areas of computer vision, including medical image processing. For example, Gulshan et al not only used the same network that was originally built for ImageNet, they also used that network Editorial and Viewpoint\"}, {\"paperId\": \"7dcf11d9118494eea19211d73f145f2acf8cd6b8\", \"abstract\": \"The UKeiG Members\\u2019 Day, held at CILIP HQ on Friday 7th June 2019, showcased three experts: Michael Upshall (UNSILO), David Haynes (City, University of London) and Dr. Tony Russell-Rose (UXLabs, 2dSearch.)

Indeed, determining whether and how artificial intelligence might contribute to reducing or exacerbating health inequities has been identified as a priority research area by several stakeholders and by numerous ethics and policy guidance documents.2\\u20134 Understanding the connection between health inequities and artificial intelligence should be a priority when deploying these technologies in public health. Since public health activities typically target populations instead of individuals and require collective action instead of individual intervention,5 introducing artificial intelligence technologies to support these activities may influence (either positively or negatively, intentionally or unintentionally) health inequities more than in other areas. As such, identifying the distinctive equity considerations and dimensions that might emerge in the public health context is critical. However, doing so is not a straightforward task. First, we cannot simply look to past technological innovations to determine which health equity considerations or implications might arise with the use of artificial intelligence in public health because technological innovations and their diffusion in health systems each produce or interact with health inequities in novel ways.1 We may not be able to assume that the trends or pathways that create or prevent inequities will be the same when implementing artificial intelligence technologies as they are with other technological innovations. This limitation may be particularly challenging with artificial intelligence technologies given their use of big data and machine learning. Second, artificial intelligence represents a vast and sometimes contested area of study and application. Here we define artificial intelligence as a branch of computer science that explores the ability of computers to imitate aspects of intelligent human behaviour, such as problem-solving, reasoning and recognition.2 Technologies that are supported by artificial intelligence are therefore numerous, and include natural language processing, object recognition and reinforcement learning, among others. The ways in which these technologies might be deployed in public health are equally numerous, including digital disease surveillance, machine learning to predict incidences of noncommunicable diseases, and others. Finally, given that health inequities are often defined as differences in health that are unjust, even what should be counted as health inequities and what it means to achieve health equity may differ according to the nature of the new technology, how it is or has been integrated into health systems and our judgements about its interaction with the public\\u2019s health.6 As a result, before research or health system interventions in this area are developed or implemented, we should first seek to conceptually map the unique ways in which inequities might manifest when artificial intelligence is implemented or used in public health. Indeed, important work examining the unique equity dimensions associated with specific artificial intelligence technologies in this area has begun.7 Yet, we posit that there are general equity considerations and dimensions that can be identified and used as starting points for the reflection of equitable artificial intelligence in public health, and that it would be of benefit for the field to have these identified and enumerated. We will briefly describe four key equity considerations and dimensions and conclude by discussing how they can be used as starting points to further understand and enhance the equitable deployment of artificial intelligence in public health.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"57fbaf35321b2c4c4c0cc2b63e72bfb9c5d5d9c9\", \"abstract\": \"Graphs are widely used as a popular representation of the network structure of connected data.

Key national strategies and legal systems are developed using artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and big data as the key, aiming to establish a data nation, also in Japan. Even in the medical field, the effect of using big data is highly expected. In addition, as a mechanism to support technology and research in the medical field, a bill concerning anonymous processing and medical information was submitted. Improvement of the social security situation is awaited not only for basic research and drug development, but also for realization of precision medicine. By using accumulated medical information, so-called big data, contribution to precision medicine that provides effective medical care to individual patients is also expected. In precision medicine, it is important to use genomic intelligence in addition to clinical information. The different genetic characteristics and constitutional personality of an individual patient can be grasped from the genomic information that constitutes an individual such as DNA sequence in addition to stored medical information. At the same time, it is necessary to secure high reliability of knowledge obtained by big data analysis in the medical field, particularly as precise knowledge is required for findings in analysis algorithms that realize precision medicine affecting human life. However, many of the production processes of knowledge obtained by machine learning are black boxes, and the basis is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the reliability of the findings obtained by medical big data analysis. Currently, medical big data analysis technology handles only structured information represented by numerical values such as blood test results. In the future, it is necessary to treat unstructured information as an analysis target in order to deal with various diseases. We will also use AI for medical big data analysis technology. Unstructured information such as image information and text information is an area in which AI excels. In this edition of the Journal, nine articles were adopted, including three reviews and six original works. Of the original five clinical papers, two are based on the National Clinical Database (NCD), and one is the database of the Japan Society for Pancreatic Surgery. Thus, papers by retrospective studies based on nationwide data are rapidly increasing in the field of gastroenterological surgery. Such a trend may probably continue in the near future. However, it is not necessarily true that only big data reflect the correct medical situation. Among various data analyses, there is also strong opinion that quality data rather than big data are important in medical science; data should be secured not only in quantity but also in quality. In diversified medicine, large data are insufficient unless analysis based on high-quality data is carried out. The possibility that misunderstanding at the initial stage may adversely affect deep learning ICT cannot be denied. Nevertheless, how to master medical information in ICT analysis including AI and big data is a question to be answered. In such an era, personal characteristics of medical professionals are extremely important; valuable information gained from face-to-face interaction is the essence of medical treatment, as is the ability to discern the truth from few cases and an inquiring mind to determine its verity. It may be correct to use big data as a final screening or final confirmation in the clinical field of gastroenterological surgery.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"ae85aa763cdd4304b62fc0b4fc68cea89b5ce9d5\", \"abstract\": \"1189 term for extremely large datasets that can be analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations. A typical example of big data is the amount of information contained in today\\u2019s electronic medical records, which contain huge digital imaging archives, pathology department and laboratory archives, and millions of digital clinical notes and diagnoses that, when analyzed, could help physicians better identify trends in diagnoses. Natural language processing is another important field of computer science that is concerned with programming computers to process and understand natural human language text, such as the text contained in an electronic medical record. Finally, it is important to note that fastmoving advancements in computer hardware and processing, such as ultrafast graphic processing units and cloud computing, are enabling the accelerated applications of AI. All of the aforementioned components are part of the new world of the field of AI. AI has been developing for many years, but it has been advancing at a more rapid pace in recent years. First, we had computer-aided diagnosis, where computers were programmed by humans to detect certain characteristics on digital images. Computer-aided diagnosis was helpful but was limited to what the computer was programmed to detect. Through artificial neural networks, AI has introduced the ability for computers to learn from experience, thus enabling AI to go much further than CAD. However, the concept of AI as it applies to radiology is much easier in theory than in practice. Many complex and tedious steps must be taken before AI can play a major role in radiology [2, 3]. What is imperative is that radiologists must continually learn how to apply this new technology to improve the care of our patients. AI will likely replace some of what we do as radiologists, and, in other cases, AI will likely help us be more accurate in what we do today [4]. Those who believe that AI could replace radiologists don\\u2019t understand the complex role of radiologists in the care of patients. Although the naive concept that AI could replace radiologists will continue to be promoted, the truth of the matter is that AI will likely help radiologists achieve advancements way beyond those currently in motion through discovery and innovation. The uniquely human However, rather than fear these challenges, we should embrace them and look for new discoveries and innovations to help us meet those challenges. As the old English-language proverb says, \\u201cNecessity is the mother of invention.\\u201d In other words, we should look to discovery and innovation in radiology to help us meet the challenges facing us today. One of the most exciting emerging technologies on the radiology horizon is not a new scanner technology but, rather, what many refer to as artificial intelligence (AI). Many of us see AI as the next big important innovation in medicine and radiology. However, others see AI as a threat to our profession. Some have even gone so far as to say that radiologists could someday be replaced by AI [1]. Rather than fear this new technology, we should embrace it and discover new and exciting ways to improve and advance the field of radiology. To accomplish this, we, as radiologists, need to begin to understand the technology behind AI and look for ways to incorporate it into our practice and ultimately improve the care of our patients. AI is defined as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, written and spoken human language recognition, decision making, and translation between languages. A major component of AI is machine learning, which is a subfield of computer science that enables computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This exciting technology of machine learning incorporates computational models and algorithms that are similar to the structure and function of our brain\\u2019s biologic neural networks. These computational models are often referred to as artificial neural networks. When these artificial neural networks process information (i.e., digital data) from numerous input flows, they have the ability to \\u201clearn\\u201d and alter their structure in much the same way that the neurons in our brain are altered with memory. Deep learning is a part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning representations of data such as recognizing characteristic images (i.e., face recognition). Deep learning is very significant as it relates to radiology because of its focus on recognizing objects in images.

Simulation might play a significant role to play in these developments as it can act as a testbed for such concepts and support the military decision makers in future operations that are enhanced by AI. Simulation is already making a significant impact in the development of AI outside of the defence sector. Companies such as DeepMind and Nvidia are using computer games and simulations to \\u201ctrain\\u201d AI and autonomous systems, analogous to humans training in simulations. The rate of progress is high, driven by increases in computing power, availability of data and improved algorithms. AI can now \\u201cbeat\\u201d humans at many computer and board games and is moving towards tackling more strategic games that have parallels with military C2. If such developments translate into the defence sphere then we could foresee humans and autonomous systems training in the same simulation systems, both separately and together, and the AI in the autonomous system being the same as that in the simulation. As autonomous systems proliferate across the nations, M&S technology and techniques might be used to improve the interoperability of autonomous systems. To maximise such synergies, it will be essential that NATO embraces all communities that have an interest in AI. Assessing the risks of potential adversary\\u2019s use of AI and commercial autonomous systems is also necessary. Despite recent advances, AI development still faces significant technological and ethical challenges and these must be monitored and addressed as necessary. 1.0 CONTEXT Artificial Intelligence or AI is a technology or concept that has developed over many decades and periodically becomes mainstream news. In the latter half of the 2010s this is still very much the case with regular forecasts of its impact on society, jobs and the world economy. Some of these predictions appear to be nearing reality and AI devices are even entering the home. AI also has the potential to influence and sometimes disrupt the ways that companies and organisations operate and AI-based technology revolutions are anticipated. AI also has enduring impact on media and culture and like much technology it can be considered to have beneficial and harmful uses and its impact has and will have political and ethical implications. Over the decades many AI predictions have come true to some degree but in some cases not at all or only partially. Good examples of this are to be found in transport where passenger aircraft have considerable levels of automation but society remains some way off from accepting pilotless passenger aircraft. For STO-MP-MSG-149 11 1 Developments in Artificial Intelligence \\u2013 Opportunities and Challenges for Military Modeling and Simulation railways, some are now fully automated whilst others continue to put high reliance on the human. Cars can now park themselves and have high levels of automation but are yet to be fully autonomous in all environments and applications. There is no doubt however, that there is a trend towards greater use of autonomous systems and AI. This is being driven by ever greater processing power together with the ability for very large data sets (\\u201cbig data\\u201d) to be captured and used to help build more capable AI. Such resources can also be accessed online in the cloud, driving down the cost of developing and distributing AI programs. The military have developed and deployed autonomous systems for a very long time, for example in the use of land and sea mines. In the 20th century proximity fuzes came into service that were semi-intelligent, sensing and exploding at the most appropriate time for the target. Analogue computers also assisted operators as part of fire control calculations and missiles and rockets in World War 2 become remotely piloted or fully autonomous. With the advent of digital computing, autonomy in military systems is commonplace, reducing the manpower requirement or in assisting the human, but there remains a significant ethical dimension in the use of fully autonomous systems. Developments in AI and autonomous systems outside of defence are of significant interest as they may provide answers how to better manage and interpret data within military command and control systems but also because they may enhance potential adversary\\u2019s capabilities. This was recognised in 2017 by the NATO Science and Technology Organization\\u2019s (STO) which made \\\"Military Decision Making using the tools of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI)\\\" one of its principal themes. The modelling and simulation (M&S) community has strived itself to develop AI, reducing or eliminating the need for human input. Sometimes termed Semi-Automated Forces (SAF) or Computer-Generated Forces (CGF) this has benefits in analysis and training, reducing the number of role players and improving consistency. Simulation itself is now being used to \\u201ctrain\\u201d AI/autonomous systems, as such environments are repeatable and controllable and can generate highly tailorable data output. However, reproducing credible and realistic behaviours in simulation remains a significant challenge and the M&S community continues to strive to enhance its AI. The computer games industry also sees AI as a challenge as games can easily lose their entertainment value if their AI is poorly implemented. 2.0 WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE? Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad topic area as it depends on what nature of human intelligence are being replicated and that AI technology can take many different forms. The Oxford Dictionary definition is \\u201cThe theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\\u201d The nature of the intelligence can range from \\u201cnarrow\\u201d intelligence which is highly tailored or specialised through to artificial \\u201cgeneral\\u201d intelligence which is flexible, adaptive and inventive, much like the human brain. There are many approaches to AI for example, decision tress, fuzzy logic and neural nets with some approaches becoming synonymous with AI. For example, machine learning is an approach that gives \\\"computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed\\u201d by learning from and making predictions from data. In broad terms AI is the \\u2018what\\u2019, machine learning is an approach to the \\u2018how\\u2019, and self-driving cars might be the \\u2018why\\u2019. Machine learning methods are based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Learning can be supervised, partially supervised or unsupervised. Neural nets or networks are computer systems modelled on the human brain and nervous system with an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Deep or reinforcement learning, which is inspired by the way animals seem to learn, has taken the neural nets approach and added layers of nodes taking advantage of current day higher processing power and making significant advances in image recognition for example and is generally seen as at the current forefront of AI technology. Developments in Artificial Intelligence \\u2013 Opportunities and Challenges for Military Modeling and Simulation 11 2 STO-MP-MSG-149 An autonomous system builds on the use of AI and extends it into the physical world, in for example a robot or vehicle, requiring an awareness of the world through sensors, a task(s) and minimal human intervention. Some argue that some AI algorithms are not really showing intelligence but are a predetermined and limited set of responses to a predetermined and limited set of inputs. Professor Isbell of Georgia Tech suggests that systems should have two features before they can be considered AI. Firstly, they must learn over time as their environment changes. Secondly, their challenge must be demanding too for humans to learn, so a machine programmed to automate repetitive work would not be considered an AI system. Another example would be the AI in many computer video games; it may appear to represent human behaviour but this is preprogrammed and there is little or no learning over time. 3.0 HISTORICAL CONTEXT An overview of the general history of AI including work on AI by the M&S community will be provided to give context to the progress currently being made and the possible trajectory of the field into the future.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"d269c1aa3651e1f6de9b48b5c7921a6c47690701\", \"abstract\": \"Philip Ball, Science Writer, Nature, London, UK. S is typically slow work. It can take years or even decades for exploratory work on, say, a new concept in materials to become a product ready for the market place. But advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to greatly accelerate that tortuous process. Computer algorithms are increasingly helping with the exploring and understanding, and the direction of experimentation, modeling, and simulation. They are working in parallel with human creativity and ingenuity to find and refine new materials for tomorrow\\u2019s technologies. Launching one effort to harness computational and datadriven resources, the Materials Genome Initiative, in 2011, US President Barack Obama laid out the objective. \\u201cThe invention of silicon circuits and lithium-ion batteries made computers and iPods and iPads possible,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut it took years to get those technologies from the drawing board to the market place. We can do it faster.\\u201d Yet sometimes the choices available to materials scientists are enough to make you despair. Take so-called \\u201chigh-entropy alloys,\\u201d1 which have high strength and are mixtures of five or more metallic elements; some may contain up to 20 elements. How can one ever hope to probe all the possible permutations and phases? Or take the exotic quantum mechanical properties discovered during the past decade or so in complex materials with compositions such as Ca10Cr7O28 and YbMgGaO4. How can we find out in any comprehensive, systematic way what other new and potentially useful behaviors might exist in combinations of elements that no one has thought to look at before? It is unfeasible to trawl blindly through all the options experimentally. Previously, the options were narrowed down largely through intuition. But human intuition becomes severely tested by both the range and complexity of the possible choices. Yet computer algorithms can now develop a kind of intuition too through the same process that we tend to use: looking for patterns and regularities in what we already know. This is machine learning (ML), an aspect of AI that aims to digest and generalize existing knowledge to find new solutions to problems. It is used today in all manner of applications in which a large amount of data exceeds human capability to assimilate it all\\u2014from genomics and drug design to analysis of financial markets and the development of gameplaying algorithms. It seems increasingly likely that some of the outstanding challenges in materials design will be solved this way too. The potential effect of AI in materials science, however, extends well beyond the discovery of new substances and compositions. Far from being merely a tool for automated materials exploration, said Benji Maruyama of the Air Force Research Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, AI might supply nothing less than a new way of doing science, helping to improve, streamline, and guide the process of acquiring new knowledge about the materials universe (see the Materials Research Society OnDemand\\u00ae Webinar at mrs.org/ ondemand-ai). \\u201cWe are on a long-term trend towards more AI being integrated into the research process,\\u201d said Patrick Riley, an AI researcher at Google. \\u201cMachine-learning algorithms could help eliminate bottlenecks that appear in the research process,\\u201d said Kristofer Reyes, a computational materials scientist at the University at Buffalo, The State University of New York. Algorithms that learn from experience might help researchers to choose and design experiments, analyze the results, and generalize the knowledge extracted. And to judge from experience in other areas, such as the autonomous game-playing capabilities of AI, it is possible that such systems could take genuinely creative leaps beyond the bounds of human intuition. In the years to come, the relationship between humans and computers might be realigned: defined no longer in terms of users and tools, but as a collaboration. \\u201cCertainly, ML can predict materials with desirable properties,\\u201d said Bryce Meredig of Citrine Informatics in Redwood City, Calif., a company that has developed a commercially available AI platform for materials informatics. \\u201cBut if we think about a future in which all materials scientists have ML-based copilots, just like in our daily lives with Alexa and Google Assistant, the possibilities are much broader.\\u201d \\u201cWe\\u2019re still at the beginning of this journey,\\u201d cautioned Riley.

The German government has also begun to work on an AI strategy and just published a first blueprint with the core themes. In this paper, we argue that such a strategy needs to be broad and comprehensive, focusing on the development of an internationally-competitive AI ecosystem in Germany. \\nA strong AI ecosystem is characterized by strong networks between science, economic actors (big companies and startups alike) and society at large. Innovations arise in particular from close exchanges and collaboration between researchers, developers, universities, companies, investors and startups. To promote such an ecosystem, a wide range of different political measures on different levels have to be integrated into a broader, comprehensive strategy. \\nThis paper discusses the central building blocks of an AI ecosystem in Germany, and offers concrete ideas and recommendations for an AI strategy based on this ecosystem approach. \\n1. AI research: Compared to other countries, Germany is lagging behind in research expenditures and must drastically increase them. Research support needs to be open to different technological approaches within AI. It also needs to be more agile to better react to emerging trends and new opportunities in AI research. Better work conditions overall are needed to compete for the best AI talent worldwide as well as clear benchmarks to measure progress in AI research. \\n2. Development of AI competencies across society: We do not only need top research. We also need broadly distributed AI competencies in society. Thus AI should not only be taught in computer sciences, but core AI modules should also be integrated into engineering and natural science programs, and be taught at schools of applied sciences. \\n3. Data as a basic resource for AI development: A strong AI ecosystem needs data for research and for the development of AI applications in industry, particularly with regard to deep learning (DL). This dimension of the ecosystem needs far more attention in Germany. Possible approaches to mobilize data for AI include the development of data pools and more advanced methods of anonymizing or synthesizing data. It is hard to compete with the big Internet platforms from the United States and China in terms of quantity of data. Instead, special emphasis on machine data, quality of data and alternative approaches to AI that can work with little data could be the cornerstones of an alternative path to a strong AI ecosystem. 4. Infrastructure demands for AI: Deep learning requires not only huge amounts of data but also great computing power. A national AI strategy would address the question of how we can ensure middle- and long-term access to the most powerful processing hardware possible for German AI research and applications. \\n5. AI development and AI application in the economy: The German economy and industry already struggles with digitalization. AI exacerbates this issue because it represents the next step of digitalization. Small- and medium-sized businesses in Germany, known as the Mittelstand, especially need support. This support could be, for example, through state-funded AI laboratories, in which companies can experiment with AI with little risk and at low costs. Mobilizing venture capital through public funds and providing better incentives for AI investments represent two more critical challenges. 6. Societal dimension of AI: The ethical and regulatory questions regarding AI need to be openly discussed and require input from many different stakeholders in German society. Here, we already see numerous initiatives and approaches, representing the topic\\u2019s arrival on the political agenda. However, more has to be done to make AI competencies and technologies more familiar within society. \\n7. A national AI strategy in an international context: Germany can only succeed in the international competition in the long-term as part of an EU-wide approach. Striving for cooperation with France offers the chance to push for a comprehensive European AI strategy. Germany, and Europe as a whole, have to become more conscious of their strategic interests in AI and act accordingly. \\nA German AI strategy should focus on the ecosystem approach and propose concrete ideas and recommendations. The strategy also needs to address how we can identify and, if possible, measure how the strategy is being implemented, and how the AI ecosystem in Germany is developing. There are many important indicators that policy makers should consult in order to evaluate the effect of their actions: the attractiveness of German institutes and universities for leading international AI researchers, the number and quality of AI patents, achievements in publishing and visibility at the most important international AI conferences, venture capital investments, the founding of firms, or the number of companies with strong AI competencies and their growth. The good thing is that Germany does not have to start from scratch; numerous countries have already published national AI strategies in which many good ideas can be found. Now is the time for Germany to follow suit. Only then can Germany become a leader of AI development.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"9d1f9c5c2be2636328b14a4d4678adf5d17591d7\", \"abstract\": \"Artificial Intelligence platforms are driven by sophisticated algorithms which have been incorporated into A.I. robots. These algorithms are also programmed to be self-teaching. This technology has resulted in producing a \\u2018super intelligent\\u2019 robot, the current best example of which is IBM\\u2019s Watson. Watson is being increasingly applied to perform a variety of tasks in the medical field, tasks which had formerly been the exclusive preserve of doctors. A.I. is replacing doctors in fields such as interpreting X-rays and scans, performing diagnoses of patients\\u2019 symptoms, in what can be described as a \\u2018consulting physician\\u2019 basis. A.I. is also being used in psychology where robots are programmed to speak to patients and counsel them. Robots have also been designed to perform sensitive surgical techniques. One is therefore able to confidently predict that the role of robots in medicine is going to increase exponentially in the future. Because medicine is not an exact science it is possible that Watson, to use one example of an existing robot, can make errors which result in injury to patients. The injured patient should then be entitled to sue for damages, as they would have been able to do if the injury had been caused by a real doctor. However, the problem which arises in this regard is that the law of torts has developed to regulate the actions of natural persons. Watson, and similar A.I. platforms, are not natural persons. This means that a patient seeking redress cannot rely on existing law relating to medical negligence or malpractice to recover damages. It is therefore imperative that appropriate legislation is passed to bridge this gap and allow the apportionment of damages to a patient which have resulted from the actions of an A.I. robot. *Correspondence to: Michael Lupton, Professor, Bond University, Queensland, Australia, E-mail: mlupton@bond.edu.au Received: June 19, 2018; Accepted: July 04, 2018; Published: July 09, 2018 Definition of A.I. and some applications A.I. is usually defined as \\u2018the capability of a computer program to perform tasks or reasoning processes that we usually associate with intelligence in a human being [1]. Artificial intelligence is inextricably linked to the ever-increasing capabilities of algorithms. A.I. has been insidiously infiltrating our lives for a number of years in the form of the GPS built into or attached to motor cars and from its humble beginnings as an animated map it has now evolved to the point where it can control or \\u2018drive\\u2019 the motor car: Spam filters are based on A.I. The Google translate service, which is now capable of translating from and to more than 70 languages is the product of statistical machine learning which in turn is imbedded in A.I. The face recognition technology employed for security purposes at airports and railway stations is also driven by A.I. The much-used iPhone app, Siri, which understands us when we speak to it and mostly responds in an intelligent way, is based on A.I. algorithms developed to facilitate speech understanding. These are just a few examples of how A.I. is increasingly becoming an essential component of everyday life for the average citizen in developed countries. The examples above do not even include the so-called Internet of things which is linked to the application of cognitive computing capabilities [2]. Computing giant IBM continues to invest massive resources in order to employ its Watson cognitive computing system to finance, personalised education and of particular interest to this article, to the field of medicine [1]. The definition of A.I. usually identifies the fact that the field can be divided into so-called \\u2018strong\\u2019 A.I. which refers to the creation of computer systems whose behaviour at certain levels would be indistinguishable from that of humans. The alternative to the above system would be \\u2018weak\\u2019 A.I., which would examine human cognition and decide how it could be applied to assist and support our limited human cognition in multiple situations e.g. modern fighter aircraft are filled with such \\u2018weak\\u2019 A.I. systems. \\u2018Weak\\u2019 A.I. systems will help pilots to maximize the potential of their sophisticated aircraft, but they will not be empowered to have an independent existence and decisionmaking process [3]. The goal with which A.I. systems in Medicine have been created is to assist and support healthcare workers to execute their normal duties more efficiently, especially in those areas which require the manipulation of data and knowledge [4]. This characteristic of the system will allow it to evaluate an electronic medical record system on an ongoing basis. This constant analysis of the records will enable it to alert the clinician when it detects patterns in clinical data which suggest significant changes in a patient\\u2019s condition or if it detects a probable contraindication to a planned treatment [5]. The fact that the algorithms in A.I. systems have the capacity to learn, will lead to the discovery of new phenomena and thus the creation of new medical knowledge. On the other hand, A.I. is a form of automation that will reduce the number of current jobs in the medical field, and there is as yet no certainty that new jobs in sufficient quantities will be created to replace those lost [5]. Lupton M (2018) Some ethical and legal consequences of the application of artificial intelligence in the field of medicine Volume 18(4): 2-7 Trends Med, 2018 doi: 10.15761/TiM.1000147 Major concerns arising from A.I. Humans owe their dominant position in the world to their intelligence not their speed or strength. Therefore, the development of A.I. systems that are \\u2018super intelligent\\u2019 in that they exceed the ability of the best human brains in practically every field could impact drastically on humanity and we should proceed down this road with care [6]. It is human intelligence which allowed man to develop tools and the technology to enable us to control our environment. It is therefore not illogical to deduce that a super intelligent system would likewise be capable of developing its own tools and technology for exerting control [7]. The dangers attached to the above occurring is that such A.I. systems would not share our evolutionary history and there is therefore no reason to believe that they would be driven by human characteristics such as a lust for power. Their default position is likely to be that they are driven to compete for and acquire resources currently used by humans, which is likely given the fact that the system is devoid of the human sense of fairness, compassion or conservatism [8]. An onus therefore rests on the creators of A.I. systems to construct and train them in such a way that the systems are wired to develop \\u2018moral\\u2019 and \\u2018ethical\\u2019 behaviour patterns so as to ensure that these super intelligent A.I. systems have a positive rather than a negative impact on society, or to use the terminology of A.I scientists, that these systems are \\u2018aligned with human interests\\u2019. To achieve this end designers, need to develop and employ agent architectures which avert the incentives of A.I. systems to manipulate and deceive their human operators, and instead remain tolerant of programmer errors [9]. Just one example of the unexpected outcomes of a task allocated to an A.I. agent is described by authors Bird and Lydell. It involved a generic algorithm which was tasked with making an oscillator. The algorithm instead repurposed the tracks on a printed circuit board on the mother board, to act as a makeshift radio to amplify oscillating signals from nearby computers. Had the algorithms been simulated on a virtual circuit board which only possessed the features that seemed relevant to the problem, it would have delivered an outcome closer to what its controllers had anticipated [4]. The above example clearly illustrates the ability of an A.I. agent, operating in the real world, to use resources in unexpected ways by for example finding \\u2018shortcuts\\u2019 or \\u2018cheats\\u2019 not accounted for in a simplified model [10]. A.I. and medical diagnosis The remarks above illustrate the scope and potential of A.I. systems. It is therefore not surprising that there is ample opportunity to employ A.I. systems in the field of medicine, some of which we will discuss below.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"d21bc07ca53034f37b0d4dd6ab7e2cb704e9aa0c\", \"abstract\": \"The Rough Set (RS) theory can be considered as a tool to reduce the input dimensionality and to deal with vagueness and uncertainty in datasets.

The most common machine learning algorithms can be either supervised or unsupervised. Supervised learning algorithms generate a function that maps inputs to desired outputs, based on a set of examples with known output (labeled examples). Unsupervised learning algorithms find patterns and relationships over a given set of inputs (unlabeled examples). Other categories of machine learning are semi-supervised learning, where an algorithm uses both labeled and unlabeled examples, and reinforcement learning, where an algorithm learns a policy of how to act given an observation of the world. Data mining is a more recently emerged field than machine learning is. Traditional data analysis techniques often fail to process large amounts of-often noisy-data efficiently. The scope of data mining is the knowledge discovery from large data amounts with the help of computers. It is an interdisciplinary area of research, that has its roots in databases, machine learning, and statistics and has contributions from many other areas such as information retrieval, pattern recognition, visualization, parallel and distributed computing. The main difference between machine learning and data mining is that machine learning algorithms focus on their effectiveness, whereas data mining algorithms focus on their efficiency and scalability. Recently, the collection of biological data has been increasing at explosive rates due to improvements of existing technologies as well as the introduction of new ones that made possible the conduction of many large scale experiments. example of the rapid biological data accumulation is the exponential growth of GenBank (Figure 1), the U.S. NIH genetic sequence database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The explosive growth in the amount of biological data demands the use of computers for the organization, the maintenance and the analysis of these data. This led to the evolution of bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of biology, computer science, and information technology. Luscombe et al. (2001) identify the aims of bioinformatics as follows: \\u2022 The organization of data in a way that allows researchers to access existing information and to submit new entries as they are produced. \\u2022 The development of tools that help in the analysis of data. \\u2022 The use of these tools to analyze the individual systems in detail, in order to gain new biological insights.

(AlphaGo is a program developed by DeepMind, a British AI company acquired by Google two years ago.) After Deep Blue\\u2019s victory against chess world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, the game of Go was the next grand challenge for game-playing artificial intelligence. Go has defied the brute-force methods in game-tree search that worked so successfully in chess. In 2012, Communications published a Research Highlight article by Sylvain Gelly et al. on computer Go, which reported that \\u201cPrograms based on Monte-Carlo tree search now play at human-master levels and are beginning to challenge top professional players.\\u201d AlphaGo combines tree-search techniques with searchspace reduction techniques that use deep learning. Its victory is a stunning achievement and another milestone in the inexorable march of AI research. By using deep\\u2013learning techniques to prune the search tree, AlphaGo can be said to augment bruteforce search with \\u201cintuition,\\u201d which it has developed by playing numerous games against itself. (Google said AlphaGo does not use Lee\\u2019s games as its training data.) By relying on learned \\u201cintuition,\\u201d AlphaGo is able to overcome the so-called Polanyi\\u2019s Paradox. The philosopher Michael Polanyi observed in 1966, \\u201cWe can know more than we can tell ... The skill of a driver cannot be replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar.\\u201d Some labor economists have viewed Polanyi\\u2019s Paradox as a major barrier for AI, arguing it implies a limit on its potential to automate human jobs. AlphaGo\\u2019s victory demonstrates machine learning provides a path around that barrier. Indeed, the automation of driving has been a major challenge for AI research over the past decade. In 2004, economists argued driving was unlikely to be automated in the near future due to Polanyi\\u2019s Paradox. A year later, a Stanford autonomous vehicle won a DARPA Grand Challenge by driving over 100 miles along an unrehearsed desert trail. Now, more than a decade later, both technology companies and car companies vigorously pursue the automation of driving. I expect the technical challenges to be resolved in the coming decade. In 1843, Ada Lovelace, well known for her work on Charles Babbage\\u2019s Analytical Engine, wrote to Babbage that she wished to see computing technology developed for \\u201cthe most effective use of mankind.\\u201d It is difficult for me to think of any computing technology other than automated driving that can be deployed in a decade or two and with such benefit for humanity. About 1.25 million people worldwide die from car accidents every year. Over 90% of these accidents are caused by human error. By automating driving, we could save over a million lives a year, as well as avoid countless injuries. At the same time, the automation of driving would have a huge disruptive effect on the global economy. Existing industries will shrivel, and whole new industries will rise. In the U.S., close to 10% of all jobs involve operating a vehicle and we can expect to see the majority of these jobs disappear. The human cost of such a profound change cannot be underestimated. As a precedent we can see what happened to U.S. manufacturing over the past 35 years. While manufacturing output in constant dollars is at an all-time high, manufacturing employment peaked around 1980 and is today lower than it was in 1947. The disappearance of millions of jobs due to automation may explain a recent, rather shocking, finding by economists Angus Deaton, winner of the 2015 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, and Anne Case, that mortality for white middle-aged Americans has been increasing over the past 25 years, due to an epidemic of suicides and afflictions stemming from substance abuse. Thus, the automation of driving would be hugely beneficial, saving lives and preventing injuries on a massive scale. At the same time, it would have a profoundly adverse impact on the labor market. In the balance, life saving and injury prevention must take precedence, and we have a moral imperative to develop and deploy automated driving. The solution to the labor problem will not be technical, but sociopolitical. As computing professionals, we also have a moral imperative to acknowledge the adverse societal consequences of the technology we develop and to engage with social scientists to find ways to address these consequences.

It is, consequently, an expensive process that can, in addition, suffer from geospatial discrepancies, thus severely impairing the comparability of death statistics at the international level. The recent advances in artificial intelligence, specifically the rise of deep learning methods, has enabled computers to make efficient decisions on a number of complex problems that were typically considered out of reach without human assistance; they require a considerable amount of data to learn from, which is typically their main limiting factor. However, the C\\u00e9piDc (Centre d\\u2019\\u00e9pid\\u00e9miologie sur les causes m\\u00e9dicales de D\\u00e9c\\u00e8s) stores an exhaustive database of death certificates at the French national scale, amounting to several millions of training examples available for the machine learning practitioner. Objective This article investigates the application of deep neural network methods to coding underlying causes of death. Methods The investigated dataset was based on data contained from every French death certificate from 2000 to 2015, containing information such as the subject\\u2019s age and gender, as well as the chain of events leading to his or her death, for a total of around 8 million observations. The task of automatically coding the subject\\u2019s underlying cause of death was then formulated as a predictive modelling problem. A deep neural network\\u2212based model was then designed and fit to the dataset. Its error rate was then assessed on an exterior test dataset and compared to the current state-of-the-art (ie, the Iris software). Statistical significance of the proposed approach\\u2019s superiority was assessed via bootstrap. Results The proposed approach resulted in a test accuracy of 97.8% (95% CI 97.7-97.9), which constitutes a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art and its accuracy of 74.5% (95% CI 74.0-75.0) assessed on the same test example. Such an improvement opens up a whole field of new applications, from nosologist-level batch-automated coding to international and temporal harmonization of cause of death statistics. A typical example of such an application is demonstrated by recoding French overdose-related deaths from 2000 to 2010. Conclusions This article shows that deep artificial neural networks are perfectly suited to the analysis of electronic health records and can learn a complex set of medical rules directly from voluminous datasets, without any explicit prior knowledge. Although not entirely free from mistakes, the derived algorithm constitutes a powerful decision-making tool that is able to handle structured medical data with an unprecedented performance. We strongly believe that the methods developed in this article are highly reusable in a variety of settings related to epidemiology, biostatistics, and the medical sciences in general.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"f8469ec34ab9ddcce2492a8ea6c86e17bafe217a\", \"abstract\": \"Smart farming is a new concept that makes agriculture more efficient and effective by using advanced information technologies.

For centuries, medicine and clinical reasoning was based on subjective personal experience, until the wider adoption of evidence-based medicine, defined as \\u2018The conscientious explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients\\u2019. To date, simple mathematical and statistical methods have been used to describe patterns within relatively small-size datasets. We are now faced with a generation of novel datasets in large quantities, from an almost infinite number of digital fingerprints (phenomes) and sources such as electronic health records, high-resolution medical imaging, wearable devices and biosensors, more widely available genetic testing and even inputs from social media. It appears that the standard means of critical appraisal and data interpretation have reached a point of saturation. Evidence-based medicine, as we know it today, is necessary, but not sufficient to meet the demands of analysing large and complex datasets, as it can be time-consuming, resource-intensive, slow to completion and expensive. Data science is still a novel field, at the intersection of several disciplines including computer science, mathematics, statistics, and health and business analytics. It has evolved across many industries to be an advanced statistical method of gathering insights from large amounts of data in order to achieve business objectives or understand user behaviours. We are at a point in healthcare where data are more widely available and accessible in a computer readable fashion than before, coincided with the surge in computer processing power that occurred over the past decade. Recently, there has been significant interest in the field of artificial intelligence and its applications to healthcare and artificial intelligence was one of the major topics of the recently published Topol Review. Artificial intelligence broadly implies the operation of computer programmes with human cognitive ability in order to enable automated solving of complex problems, including perception, recognition, memory and learning. With a growing number of massive datasets and the increased computational power of the machines, a more unique type of artificial intelligence called machine learning has emerged. Machine learning transforms the inputs of an algorithm into outputs using statistical, data-driven rules that are automatically derived from a large set of examples, rather than being explicitly specified by humans. More specifically, a subfield of machine learning called deep learning where the algorithms are created from the data itself and determined by the number of layers (unsupervised learning) rather than initial human rules and postulates (supervised learning) is gaining increasing application in healthcare and already showing to compare with clinicians in the field of imaging, pathology, skin disease diagnosis, ophthalmology, cardiac arrhythmia detection and even sepsis management. Although the majority of the described examples have not been tested in pragmatic clinical trials, they hold significant potential, primarily because they could enable assessment, monitoring, diagnosis and management of a greater number of patients at a lower cost. In addition, artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce diagnostic errors as a quality assurance tool, as well as being used in workflow management. Consequently, it could reduce the administrative burden of clinicians and provide them with the \\u2018gift of time\\u2019 to prioritise treating patients.

Humans have many remarkable capabilities. Among them a capability that stands out in importance is the human ability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations, based on perceptions of distance, speed, direction, intent, likelihood and other attributes of physical and mental objects. A familiar example is driving a car in city traffic. Mechanization of this ability is a challenging objective of machine intelligence. Science deals not with reality but with models of reality. In large measure, models of reality in scientific theories are based on classical, Aristotelian, bivalent logic. The brilliant successes of science are visible to all. But when we take a closer look, what we see is that alongside the brilliant successes there are areas where achievement of human-level machine intelligence is still a distant objective. We cannot write programs that can summarize a book. We cannot automate driving a car in heavy city traffic. And we are far from being able to construct systems which can understand natural language. Why is the achievement of human-level machine intelligence a distant objective? What is widely unrecognized is that one of the principal reasons is the fundamental conflict between the precision of bivalent logic and imprecision of the real world. In the world of bivalent logic, every proposition is either true or false, with no shades of truth allowed. In the real world, as perceived by humans, most propositions are true to a degree. Humans have a remarkable capability to reason and make rational decisions in an environment of imprecision, uncertainty, incompleteness of information and partiality of truth. It is this capability that is beyond the reach of bivalent logic\\u2014a logic which is intolerant of imprecision and partial truth. A much better fit to the real world is fuzzy logic. In fuzzy logic, everything is or is allowed to be graduated, that is, be a matter of degree or, equivalently, fuzzy. Furthermore, in fuzzy logic everything is or is allowed to be granulated, with a granule being a clump of elements drawn together by indistinguishability, similarity, proximity or functionality. Graduation and granulation play key roles in the ways in which humans deal with complexity and imprecision. In this connection, it should be noted that, in large measure, fuzzy logic is inspired by the ways in which humans deal with complexity, imprecision and partiality of truth. It is in this sense that fuzzy logic is human-centric. In coming years, fuzzy logic and fuzzylogic-based methods are likely to play increasingly important roles in achievement of human-level machine intelligence. In addition, soft computing is certain to grow in visibility and importance. Basically, soft computing is a coalition of methodologies which in one way or another are directed at the development of better models of reality, human reasoning, risk assessment and decision making. This is the primary motivation for soft computing\\u2014a coalition of fuzzy logic, neurocomputing, evolutionary computing, probabilistic computing and machine learning. The guiding principle of soft computing is that, in general, better results can be achieved through the use of constituent methodologies of soft computing in combination rather than in a stand-alone mode.

Preface Excerpt Machine learning is a major subfield in computational intelligence (also called artificial intelligence). Its main objective is to use computational methods to extract information from data. Neural network methods, generally regarded as forming the first wave of breakthrough in machine learning, became popular in the late 1980s, while kernel methods arrived in a second wave in the second half of the 1990s. This is the first single-authored textbook to give a unified treatment of machine learning methods and their applications in the environmental sciences. Machine learning methods began to infiltrate the environmental sciences in the 1990s. Today, thanks to their powerful nonlinear modeling capability, they are no longer an exotic fringe species, as they are heavily used in satellite data processing, in general circulation models (GCM), in weather and climate prediction, air quality forecasting, analysis and modeling of environmental data, oceanographic and hydrological forecasting, ecological modeling, and in the monitoring of snow, ice and forests, etc. This book presents machine learning methods and their applications in the environmental sciences (including satellite remote sensing, atmospheric science, climate science, oceanography, hydrology and ecology), written at a level suitable for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates. It is also valuable for researchers and practitioners in environmental sciences interested in applying these new methods to their own work. Chapters 1-3, intended mainly as background material for students, cover the standard statistical methods used in environmental sciences.

However, the manual analysis of the EEG signal is very complex, time-consuming, and depends on the expertise and experience of the users. Hence, nowadays research is conducted on automated EEG signal analysis using artificial intelligence and computer-aided technologies. This would allow fast and highly accurate results. The goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review of the EEG signal analysis using deep learning (DL).Methods: This systematic literature review of EEG processing using Deep Learning (DL) was achieved on Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct databases, resulting in 403 identified papers. All collected studies were analyzed based on main disorders studied, type of tasks performed, data source, stages of analysis, and DL architecture.Results: DL in EEG processing is promising in various research applications. It covered the common neurological disorders diagnosis such as epilepsy, movement disorder, depression, schizophrenia, autism, alcohol use, attention, memory, sleep, pain, etc. The main tasks covered by the included studies are detection and classification. The average range of data sources utilized by the included studies is 127 subjects with an EEG recording a total duration of 458 hours. In fact, we identified the use of a plethora of DL architecture for EEG analysis. 57% of papers used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), whereas Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were the architecture choice of about 12% of papers. Combinations of CNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) were used in 13% of studies. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Autoencoder (AEs) were used in 5% and 4% of papers respectively. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBMs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), and other hybrid architectures appeared in 1% of studies.Conclusion: This systematic review showed that DL is a powerful tool to process, analyze, and interpret EEG data without requiring extraction steps. These intelligent models can allow self-learning from the training data. On the other hand, DL models need a lot of data to learn, while suffering from a lack of confidence due to their black-box nature. Hence, studies on transfer learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) could help in solving such issues. Big Data, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), and closed-loop technology can also help DL-based systems in achieving fast, and accurate processing of EEG recordings.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"15bbfdea5d3b65c9cdc11b399562a0242f159fcb\", \"abstract\": \"Currently, great efforts are being put toward the early identification of preclinical, biological, clinical, and laboratory markers that are able to predict the conversion of \\u201ccognitively intact\\u201d patients to overt dementia. An example of a successful biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders, and specifically of conversion from early stage of dementia of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease or Lewy body dementia (encompassing dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson\\u2019s disease (PD) dementia) and of progression of the diseases from mild to more pronounced stages of dementia, is represented by resting state, eyes-closed electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms. Patients with dementia exhibit a general reduction of power in the alpha and beta bands and high power of widespread delta and theta rhythms when compared with nondemented patients. Specifically, dementia is associated with dominant frequency variability with the appearance of a prealpha (a fast theta rhythm of 5.5-7.5 Hz) band, now listed as a supportive biomarker in the latest consensus criteria for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies, and a progressively increased relative power of theta band is described in PD dementia patients as cognition declines. The renaissance of applying clinical EEG to dementia in neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with the development of new analytical methods and breakthrough discoveries pertaining to the neuronal mechanisms underlying EEG features. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) is a derivative of regular EEG in which an offline analysis of frequency and amplitude allows the identification of specific, discrete patterns of brain wave activity. It is important to note that the source analogical data must first be visually inspected and evaluated by an expert neurophysiologist before mathematical translation of the data occurs. A thorough understanding and firm knowledge of clinical EEG features, and of mathematics and computing science, is required to prevent erroneous interpretations of digitally displayed mathematical constructs (eg, amplitude, frequency, coherence maps). The application of artificial intelligence, and more specifically machine-learning techniques, to EEG signal analysis is one possible solution that will allow wider application of EEG analysis in clinical practice as it does not require a deep knowledge of the internal workings of the machine when processing input data to give output results, assuming that machine learning could be envisioned, in clinical practice, as a \\u201cblack box\\u201d (although it is not, strictly). The black box metaphor, which dates back to the early days of cybernetics and behaviorism, typically refers to a system in which we can observe only the inputs and outputs, but not the internal workings. To entirely understand the internal workings would require a meta system, that is, a system with a higher degree than the system itself that allows one to examine the internal working of the system from the outside. This essentially represents a variation of the G\\u00f6del incompleteness theorems, whose explanation is well beyond the scope of this editorial. Machine-learning algorithms use mathematical, computational methods to derive information directly from data without applying predetermined mathematical models or equations. These algorithms adaptively improve their own performances as the analyzed examples increase in number. Machine learning might thus appear as the keystone of replacing human intelligence when interpreting complex signals (including EEG signals) and applying the results to routine clinical practice. It is important to distinguish between learning tasks that human examiners can already do well and learning those tasks where physicians have only limited success. Interesting examples of machine learning in medical research are algorithms that allow computers to make increasingly accurate predictions to prevent infectious epidemics, improve global health, or accurately and timely diagnose tumors or rare diseases. These are examples of a supervised learning method where the computer is provided both the input dataset and *Corresponding to: Dr. Laura Bonanni, Department of Neuroscience and Imaging, University G. d\\u2019Annunzio of Chieti-Pescara, Via dei Vestini 66100 Chieti, Italy; E-mail: l.bonanni@unich.it\"}, {\"paperId\": \"e6864cd49f78d4ff630c94e41233154f59a26c24\", \"abstract\": \"1.

Artificial intelligence (AI) will bring changes to the professional life of radiologists, just as it has modified many other aspects of our lives. Since the invention of electricity, the internet, and most recently AI, general purpose technologies have made it possible for societies to progress and improve their quality of life. Radiologists are not the only, or even the first, professionals to have their specialty modified by AI. Other areas of medicine have also been thus affected. Recently, one group of researchers developed software for cell phones and conducted a study in which the software was shown to distinguish malignant melanomas from benign lesions more accurately than did the dermatologists participating in the study(1). Although the role of the dermatologist is much broader than the classification of lesions, that finding could be an initial indication that AI will also modify the labor market in that field. Currently, the vast majority of laboratory tests are analyzed in automated systems, which does not seem to bother anyone. The need for trained personnel to quantify red blood cells has long since ceased to exist. Likewise, advances in the field of computer vision have begun to produce improved sensitivity in the detection of tumor in histopathological specimens when compared to human analysis(2). The main factors that allowed such advances in artificial intelligence were the abundance of data, the development of artificial neural networks, and the increased affordability of the hardware: \\u2022 Currently, data are collected by various instruments. If AI is the new electricity, data is the new coal. \\u2022 The development of artificial neural networks allowed some of the problems with other machine learning techniques to be solved. In traditional methods, which are the basis of some auxiliary diagnostic software\\u2014computer-aided detection\\u2014increasing the amount of data improves accuracy to a certain extent. In the deep learning technique, which uses hidden layers of artificial neural networks, the accuracy tends to continue to increase as new data are added. For example, in 2015, in an annual competition of object recognition in everyday images, the performance of a machine surpassed that of a human for the first time(3). Deep learning is a branch of machine learning, which is in turn one of the branches of AI. \\u2022 The increased affordability of hardware, notably processing and storage devices, also fostered advancement in the area. Currently, one can purchase a laptop with the same processing power as the most powerful supercomputer manufactured in the year 2000, the difference being that the laptop will cost approximately 40,000 times less than the 110 million dollars spent on the supercomputer and will weigh much less than its 106 tons(4). Advances in the field of computer vision have aroused the interest of technology giants and various government sectors in highly lucrative areas of great global interest. Autonomous cars and drones with automatic target recognition require instantaneous processing of images, do not tolerate errors, and are not supposed to rely on a human who is readily able to modify their operation. Although this dispersion could apparently cause a delay in the influence of AI in the radiology market, advances in the automotive and space sectors are commonly catalysts for advances in other sectors, potentially accelerating the pace of new discoveries in the field of imaging. The implementation of AI techniques in medical imaging has particular challenges. Diagnoses are not always confirmed; classifications and concepts are not always unanimous, nor are they eternal(5). The structures of the human body present great variation in terms of their normal dimensions and textures, such variation potentially masking pathological conditions. Knowledge regarding the automated analysis of medical images has spread rapidly. One example is provided by the most recent Data Science Bowl(6), which offered a total of a million dollars in prizes for teams that developed and made available the best automated nodule classification algorithms for chest computed tomography (CT). Several participating teams had never worked in the field of medical imaging, and many of them likely chose to work in the field only because of the competition. The impact of AI on the routine of the radiologist will probably occur gradually. Software will provide data that we cannot extract from the images, prioritize examinations according to disease severity(7), and, among other resources, will gradually become part of the routine. In certain areas of radiology, AI has already proven capable of generating parts of the radiological report, including a preliminary description of the imaging findings and the measurement of some lesions. However, the main contribution of the radiologist is not simply to provide this information but to integrate it with the clinical data, contributing in a more holistic way to the diagnosis and individualized treatment of the patient. This type of information integration will take more time to be replicated by machines. Nevertheless, radiologists who know how to use the\"}, {\"paperId\": \"d6ff1bb3cbdf74ccbd93bd13dfb105a5f81a4757\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"2fe5ef87aa59e66a80032b840ace1f8a629e2825\", \"abstract\": \"We propose a quantum machine learning algorithm for efficiently solving a class of problems encoded in quantum controlled unitary operations. The central physical mechanism of the protocol is the iteration of a quantum time-delayed equation that introduces feedback in the dynamics and eliminates the necessity of intermediate measurements. The performance of the quantum algorithm is analyzed by comparing the results obtained in numerical simulations with the outcome of classical machine learning methods for the same problem. The use of time-delayed equations enhances the toolbox of the field of quantum machine learning, which may enable unprecedented applications in quantum technologies. Introduction One of the main consequences of the revolution in computation sciences, started by Alan Turing, Konrad Zuse and John Von Neumann, among others,1, 2 is that computers are capable of substituting us and improving our performance in an increasing number of tasks. This is due to the advances in the development of complex algorithms and the technological refinement allowing for faster processing and larger storage. One of the goals in this area, in the frame of bio-inspired technologies, is the design of algorithms that provide computers human-like capacities such as image and speech recognition, as well as preliminary steps in some aspects related to creativity. These achievements would enable us to interact with computers in a more efficient manner. This research, together with other similar projects, is carried out in the field of artificial intelligence.3 In particular, researchers in the area of machine learning (ML) inside artificial intelligence are devoted to the design of algorithms responsible of training the machine with data, such that it is able to find a given optimal relation according to specified criteria.4 More precisely, ML is divided in three main lines depending on the nature of the protocol. In supervised learning, the goal is to teach the machine a known function without explicitly introducing it in its code. In unsupervised learning, the goal is that the machine develops the ability to classify data by grouping it in different subsets depending on its characteristics. In reinforcement learning, the goal is that the machine selects a sequence of actions depending on its interaction with an environment for an optimal transition from the initial to the final state. The previous ML techniques have also been studied in the quantum regime in a field called quantum machine learning5\\u201312 with two main motivations. The first one is to exploit the promised speedup of quantum protocols for improving the already existing classical ones. The second one is to develop unique quantum machine learning protocols for combining them with other quantum computational tasks. Apart from quantum machine learning, fields like quantum neural networks, or the more general quantum artificial intelligence, have also addressed similar problems.13\\u201317 Here, we introduce a quantum machine learning algorithm for finding the optimal control state of a multitask controlled unitary operation. It is based on a sequentially-applied time-delayed equation that allows one to implement feedback-driven dynamics without the need of intermediate measurements. The purely quantum encoding permits to speedup the training process by evaluating all possible choices in parallel. Finally, we analyze the performance of the algorithm comparing the ideal solution with the one obtained by the algorithm. Results Quantum Machine Learning Algorithm The first step in the description of the algorithm is the definition of the concept of multitask controlled unitary operations U . In essence, these do not differ from ordinary controlled operations, but the multitask label is selected to emphasize that more than ar X iv :1 61 2. 05 53 5v 1 [ qu an tph ] 1 6 D ec 2 01 6 two operations on the target subspace are in principle possible. Mathematically, we define them as U = d \\u2211 i=1 |ci\\u3009\\u3008ci|\\u2297 si, (1) where |ci\\u3009 denotes the control state, and si is the reduced or effective unitary operation that U performs on the target subspace when the control is on |ci\\u3009. Our algorithm is appropriate when U is experimentally implementable but its internal structure, |ci\\u3009 and si, are unknown. The goal is to find the optimal |ci\\u3009 for fixed input and output states, |in\\u3009 and |out\\u3009, in the target subspace. The protocol consists in sequentially reapplying the same dynamics in such a way that the initial state in the signal subspace is always |in\\u3009, while the initial state in the control subspace is the output of the previous cycle. The equation modeling the dynamics is d dt |\\u03c8(t)\\u3009=\\u2212i [ \\u03b8(t\\u2212 ti)\\u03b8(t f \\u2212 t)\\u03ba1H1 |\\u03c8(t)\\u3009+\\u03ba2H2 (|\\u03c8(t)\\u3009\\u2212 |\\u03c8(t\\u2212\\u03b4 )\\u3009) ] . (2) In this equation \\u03b8 is the Heaviside function, H1 is the Hamiltonian giving rise to U with U = e\\u2212i\\u03ba1H1(t f\\u2212ti), and H2 is the Hamiltonian connecting the input and output states, with \\u03ba1 and \\u03ba2 the coupling constants of each Hamiltonian. We point out that this evolution cannot be realized with ordinary unitary or dissipative techniques. Nevertheless, recent studies in time delayed equations provide all the ingredients for the implementation of this kind of processes.18\\u201320 Up to future experimental analyses involving the scalability of the presented examples, the inclusion of time delayed terms in the evolution equation is a realistic approach in the technological framework provided by current quantum platforms. Another important feature of Eq. (2) is that it only acquires physical meaning once the output is normalized. Regarding the behavior of the equation, each term has a specific role in the learning algorithm. The mechanism is inspired in the most intuitive classical technique for solving this problem, which is the comparison between the input and output states together with the correspondent modification of the control state. Here, the first Hamiltonian produces the input-output transition while the second Hamiltonian produces the reward by populating the control states responsible of the desired modification of the target subspace. The structure of H2 guarantees that only the population in the control |ci\\u3009 associated with the optimal si is increased, H2 = 1\\u2297 (\\u2212i |in\\u3009\\u3008out|+ i |out\\u3009\\u3008in|) . (3) Notice that while this Hamiltonian does not contain explicit information about |ci\\u3009, the solution of the problem, its multiplication with the feedback term, |\\u03c8(t)\\u3009\\u2212 |\\u03c8(t\\u2212\\u03b4 )\\u3009, is responsible for introducing the reward as an intrinsic part of the dynamics. This is a convenient approach because it eliminates the measurements required during the training phase. We would also like to point out the similarity existing between the effect of this term in our quantum evolution and gradient ascent techniques in algorithms for artificial intelligence.3 A possible strategy to perform the learning protocol would be to feed the system with random control states, measure each result, and combine them to obtain the final solution. However, we have discovered that it suffices to initialize the control subspace in a superposition of the elements of the basis. We would like to remark that this purely quantum feature reduces significantly the required resources, because a single initial state replaces a set of random states large enough to cover all possible solutions. The specific example we address is given by the excitation transport produced by the controlled SWAP gate. In this scenario, the complete system is an n-node network, where each node is composed by a control and a target qubit. The control states are in a superposition of open and close, |o\\u3009 and |c\\u3009, while the target qubits are written in the standard {|0\\u3009 , |1\\u3009} basis denoting the absence or presence of excitations. We define U , the multitask controlled unitary operation, to implement the SWAP gate between connected nodes only if all the controls of the corresponding nodes are in the open state, |o\\u3009. See Fig. 1 for a graphical representation of the most simple cases, the two and three node line networks. The explicit formula for U2 is given by U2 = (|cc\\u3009\\u3008cc|+ |co\\u3009\\u3008co|+ |oc\\u3009\\u3008oc|)\\u22971+ |oo\\u3009\\u3008oo|\\u2297 s12, (4) where si j represents the SWAP gate between qubits i and j. Although we have employed unitary operations for illustration purposes, the equation requires the translation to Hamiltonians. In order to do so, we first select \\u03ba1(t f \\u2212 ti) to be \\u03c0/2 and calculate the matrix logarithm, H1 = (|oo\\u3009\\u3008oo|)\\u2297h12.

Objective This study aims to survey empirical scholarly literature on the application of algorithmic and data-driven technologies in mental health initiatives to identify the legal and ethical issues that have been raised. Methods We searched for peer-reviewed empirical studies on the application of algorithmic technologies in mental health care in the Scopus, Embase, and Association for Computing Machinery databases. A total of 1078 relevant peer-reviewed applied studies were identified, which were narrowed to 132 empirical research papers for review based on selection criteria. Conventional content analysis was undertaken to address our aims, and this was supplemented by a keyword-in-context analysis. Results We grouped the findings into the following five categories of technology: social media (53/132, 40.1%), smartphones (37/132, 28%), sensing technology (20/132, 15.1%), chatbots (5/132, 3.8%), and miscellaneous (17/132, 12.9%). Most initiatives were directed toward detection and diagnosis. Most papers discussed privacy, mainly in terms of respecting the privacy of research participants. There was relatively little discussion of privacy in this context. A small number of studies discussed ethics directly (10/132, 7.6%) and indirectly (10/132, 7.6%). Legal issues were not substantively discussed in any studies, although some legal issues were discussed in passing (7/132, 5.3%), such as the rights of user subjects and privacy law compliance. Conclusions Ethical and legal issues tend to not be explicitly addressed in empirical studies on algorithmic and data-driven technologies in mental health initiatives. Scholars may have considered ethical or legal matters at the ethics committee or institutional review board stage. If so, this consideration seldom appears in published materials in applied research in any detail. The form itself of peer-reviewed papers that detail applied research in this field may well preclude a substantial focus on ethics and law. Regardless, we identified several concerns, including the near-complete lack of involvement of mental health service users, the scant consideration of algorithmic accountability, and the potential for overmedicalization and techno-solutionism. Most papers were published in the computer science field at the pilot or exploratory stages. Thus, these technologies could be appropriated into practice in rarely acknowledged ways, with serious legal and ethical implications.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"10ffcae001fa724f9fd49fe0726c32166df9209b\", \"abstract\": \"Data mining is the discovery of meaningful information or unrevealed patterns in data.

It was proved that the program could efficiently predict the fitness of protein sequences for different target properties (predictive models with coefficient of determination values ranging from 0.58 to 0.92). By combining machine learning and protein evolution, PyPEF enabled the screening of proteins with various functions, reaching a screening capacity of more than 500,000 protein sequence variants in the timeframe of only a few minutes on a personal computer. PyPEF displayed significant accuracies on four public data sets (different proteins and properties) and underlined the potential of integrating data-driven technologies for covering different philosophies by either predicting the fitness of the variants to the highest accuracy accounting for epistatic effects or capturing the general trend of introduced mutations on the fitness in directed protein evolution campaigns. In essence, PyPEF can provide a powerful solution to current sequence exploration and combinatorial problems faced in protein engineering through exhaustive in silico screening of the sequence space.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"debad915d24069c261c3f5ae967dcb3fdc0a0142\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"5cab50974b97872d2f8e9f4f486f0eb12ebfa67c\", \"abstract\": \"Machine learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable methodology to describe, discover, and predict complex physical phenomena that efficiently help us learn underlying functional rules, especially in cases when conventional modeling approaches cannot be applied. While conventional feedforward neural networks are typically limited to performing tasks related to static patterns in data, recursive models can both work iteratively based on a changing input and discover complex dynamical relationships in the data. Deep language models can model flexible modalities of data and are capable of learning rich dynamical behaviors as they operate on discrete or continuous symbols that define the states of a physical system, yielding great potential toward end-to-end predictions. Similar to how words form a sentence, materials can be considered as a self-assembly of physically interacted building blocks, where the emerging functions of materials are analogous to the meaning of sentences. While discovering the fundamental relationships between building blocks and function emergence can be challenging, language models, such as recurrent neural networks and long-short term memory networks, and, in particular, attention models, such as the transformer architecture, can solve many such complex problems. Application areas of such models include protein folding, molecular property prediction, prediction of material failure of complex nonlinear architected materials, and also generative strategies for materials discovery.

Recently, work has been done to address the diversity of topics covered in the course and to create a theme-based approach. Russell and Norvig present an agent-centered approach [9]. Others have been working to integrate Robotics into the AI course [1, 2, 3].We present work on a project funded by the National Science Foundation with a goal of unifying the artificial intelligence course around the theme of machine learning. This involves the development and testing of an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI topics that emphasizes the relationship between AI and computer science. Machine learning is inherently connected with the AI core topics and provides methodology and technology to enhance real-world applications within many of these topics. Machine learning also provides a bridge between AI technology and modern software engineering. In his article, Mitchell discusses the increasingly important role that machine learning plays in the software world and identifies three important areas: data mining, difficult-to-program applications, and customized software applications [6].We have developed a suite of adaptable, hands-on laboratory projects that can be closely integrated into the introductory AI course. Each project involves the design and implementation of a learning system which will enhance a particular commonly-deployed application. The goal is to enhance the student learning experience in the introductory artificial intelligence course by (1) introducing machine learning elements into the AI course, (2) implementing a set of unifying machine learning laboratory projects to tie together the core AI topics, and (3) developing, applying, and testing an adaptable framework for the presentation of core AI topics which emphasizes the important relationship between AI and computer science in general, and software development in particular.

Yet, nearly all functional materials are still discovered by \\\"trial-and-error\\\", of which the lack of predictability affords a major materials bottleneck to technological innovation. The average \\\"molecule-to-market\\\" lead time for materials discovery is currently 20 years. This is far too long for industrial needs, as highlighted by the Materials Genome Initiative, which has ambitious targets of up to 4-fold reductions in average molecule-to-market lead times. Such a large step change in progress can only be realistically achieved if one adopts an entirely new approach to materials discovery. Fortunately, a fundamentally new approach to materials discovery has been emerging, whereby data science with artificial intelligence offers a prospective solution to speed up these average molecule-to-market lead times. This approach is known as data-driven materials discovery. Its broad prospects have only recently become a reality, given the timely and major advances in \\\"big data\\\", artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing (HPC). Access to massive data sets has been stimulated by government-regulated open-access requirements for data and literature. Natural-language processing (NLP) and machine-learning (ML) tools that can mine data and find patterns therein are becoming mainstream. Exascale HPC capabilities that can aid data mining and pattern recognition and also generate their own data from calculations are now within our grasp. These timely advances present an ideal opportunity to develop data-driven materials-discovery strategies to systematically design and predict new chemicals for a given device application. This Account shows how data science can afford materials discovery via a four-step \\\"design-to-device\\\" pipeline that entails (1) data extraction, (2) data enrichment, (3) material prediction, and (4) experimental validation. Massive databases of cognate chemical and property information are first forged from \\\"chemistry-aware\\\" natural-language-processing tools, such as ChemDataExtractor, and enriched using machine-learning methods and high-throughput quantum-chemical calculations. New materials for a bespoke application can then be predicted by mining these databases with algorithmic encodings of relationships between chemical structures and physical properties that are known to deliver functional materials. These may take the form of classification, enumeration, or machine-learning algorithms. A data-mining workflow short-lists these predictions to a handful of lead candidate materials that go forward to experimental validation. This design-to-device approach is being developed to offer a roadmap for the accelerated discovery of new chemicals for functional applications. Case studies presented demonstrate its utility for photovoltaic, optical, and catalytic applications. While this Account is focused on applications in the physical sciences, the generic pipeline discussed is readily transferable to other scientific disciplines such as biology and medicine.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"4e383bb858f43beacbef91fe65db5b81f5cc8d6c\", \"abstract\": \"Interdisciplinary research from the learning sciences has helped us understand a great deal about the way that humans learn, and as a result we now have an improved understanding about how best to teach and train people.

The consistency between CNNs and human observers, however, is little above what can be expected by chance alone--indicating that humans and CNNs are likely implementing very different strategies (3.) CORnet-S, a recurrent model termed the \\\"current best model of the primate ventral visual stream\\\", fails to capture essential characteristics of human behavioural data and behaves essentially like a ResNet-50 in our analysis--that is, just like a standard feedforward network. Taken together, error consistency analysis suggests that the strategies used by human and machine vision are still very different--but we envision our general-purpose error consistency analysis to serve as a fruitful tool for quantifying future progress.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"1b98d66ef56dc511b6d7400fa33e8bfcf9f753d7\", \"abstract\": \"Many of the current scientific advances in the life sciences have their origin in the intensive use of data for knowledge discovery.

This confounds traditional trackers operating on unresolved targets, leading to erroneous state estimates or loss of track. This paper presents a computationally feasible solution to this problem using Metron s Unified Theory of Data Fusion (UDF). UDF is a Bayesian method that maintains a probability density on the joint target state space. It operates without explicitly enumerating multiple data-totarget associations. This is particularly important for unresolved targets where the data cannot be attributed to a single target. Likelihood functions for two Rayleigh targets over a range of SNRs are examined first to develop insight. The final example presents the application to tracking two low-SNR targets crossing the radar beam.Sensor Data Fusion is the process of combining incomplete and imperfect pieces of mutually complementary sensor information in such a way that a better understanding of an underlying real-world phenomenon is achieved.

To address the human intelligence limitations in discovering reduced-order models, we propose to supplement human thinking with artificial intelligence. Our three-pronged strategy consists of learning (i) models expressed in analytical form, (ii) which are evaluated a posteriori, and iii) using exclusively integral quantities from the reference solution as prior knowledge. In point (i), we pursue interpretable models expressed symbolically as opposed to black-box neural networks, the latter only being used during learning to efficiently parameterize the large search space of possible models. In point (ii), learned models are dynamically evaluated a posteriori in the computational solver instead of based on a priori information from preprocessed high-fidelity data, thereby accounting for the specificity of the solver at hand such as its numerics. Finally in point (iii), the exploration of new models is solely guided by predefined integral quantities, e.g., averaged quantities of engineering interest in Reynolds-averaged or large-eddy simulations (LES). We use a coupled deep reinforcement learning framework and computational solver to concurrently achieve these objectives.

Proving that we are human is now part of many tasks that we do on the internet, such as creating an email account, voting in an online poll, or even downloading a scientific paper. One of the most popular tests is text-based CAPTCHA, where would-be users are asked to decipher letters that may be distorted, partially obscured, or shown against a busy background. This test is used because computers find it tricky, but (most) humans do not. George et al. developed a hierarchical model for computer vision that was able to solve CAPTCHAs with a high accuracy rate using comparatively little training data.

Science, this issue p. eaag2612 A hierarchical computer vision model solves CAPTCHAs with a high accuracy rate using relatively little training data. INTRODUCTION Compositionality, generalization, and learning from a few examples are among the hallmarks of human intelligence. CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart), images used by websites to block automated interactions, are examples of problems that are easy for people but difficult for computers. CAPTCHAs add clutter and crowd letters together to create a chicken-and-egg problem for algorithmic classifiers\\u2014the classifiers work well for characters that have been segmented out, but segmenting requires an understanding of the characters, which may be rendered in a combinatorial number of ways. CAPTCHAs also demonstrate human data efficiency: A recent deep-learning approach for parsing one specific CAPTCHA style required millions of labeled examples, whereas humans solve new styles without explicit training. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce recursive cortical network (RCN), a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing\\u2013based inference handles recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified manner. RCN learns with very little training data and fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs by generatively segmenting characters. In addition, RCN outperforms deep neural networks on a variety of benchmarks while being orders of magnitude more data-efficient. RATIONALE Modern deep neural networks resemble the feed-forward hierarchy of simple and complex cells in the neocortex. Neuroscience has postulated computational roles for lateral and feedback connections, segregated contour and surface representations, and border-ownership coding observed in the visual cortex, yet these features are not commonly used by deep neural nets. We hypothesized that systematically incorporating these findings into a new model could lead to higher data efficiency and generalization. Structured probabilistic models provide a natural framework for incorporating prior knowledge, and belief propagation (BP) is an inference algorithm that can match the cortical computational speed. The representational choices in RCN were determined by investigating the computational underpinnings of neuroscience data under the constraint that accurate inference should be possible using BP. RESULTS RCN was effective in breaking a wide variety of CAPTCHAs with very little training data and without using CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. By comparison, a convolutional neural network required a 50,000-fold larger training set and was less robust to perturbations to the input. Similar results are shown on one- and few-shot MNIST (modified National Institute of Standards and Technology handwritten digit data set) classification, where RCN was significantly more robust to clutter introduced during testing. As a generative model, RCN outperformed neural network models when tested on noisy and cluttered examples and generated realistic samples from one-shot training of handwritten characters. RCN also proved to be effective at an occlusion reasoning task that required identifying the precise relationships between characters at multiple points of overlap. On a standard benchmark for parsing text in natural scenes, RCN outperformed state-of-the-art deep-learning methods while requiring 300-fold less training data. CONCLUSION Our work demonstrates that structured probabilistic models that incorporate inductive biases from neuroscience can lead to robust, generalizable machine learning models that learn with high data efficiency. In addition, our model\\u2019s effectiveness in breaking text-based CAPTCHAs with very little training data suggests that websites should seek more robust mechanisms for detecting automated interactions. Breaking CAPTCHAs using a generative vision model. Text-based CAPTCHAs exploit the data efficiency and generative aspects of human vision to create a challenging task for machines. By handling recognition and segmentation in a unified way, our model fundamentally breaks the defense of text-based CAPTCHAs. Shown are the parses by our model for a variety of CAPTCHAs . Learning from a few examples and generalizing to markedly different situations are capabilities of human visual intelligence that are yet to be matched by leading machine learning models. By drawing inspiration from systems neuroscience, we introduce a probabilistic generative model for vision in which message-passing\\u2013based inference handles recognition, segmentation, and reasoning in a unified way. The model demonstrates excellent generalization and occlusion-reasoning capabilities and outperforms deep neural networks on a challenging scene text recognition benchmark while being 300-fold more data efficient. In addition, the model fundamentally breaks the defense of modern text-based CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) by generatively segmenting characters without CAPTCHA-specific heuristics. Our model emphasizes aspects such as data efficiency and compositionality that may be important in the path toward general artificial intelligence.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"ef117e009875e908f2bc3fe11f56f42272eec8a9\", \"abstract\": \"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, in particular, have gained significant interest in many fields, including pharmaceutical sciences.

Several 2017 technology trends point to the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care. Gartner's Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2017 (Cearley, Walker, & Burke, 2016) highlight three top trends: A and advanced machine learning, intelligent apps, and intelligence things. Let's look at each.First, certain technologies and specific techniques, such as deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing, are encompassed within the AI and machine-learning concept. These techniques create software programs that are more than just rulebased systems. Rather, these systems can \\\"understand, learn, predict, adapt and appear intelligent\\\" (Cearley et al., 2016). Their ability to learn is key to their functionality. For example, a machine-learning system can analyze numerous electronic health records (EHRs) and recommend potential effective treatments. As more datasets are added, the system can learn and adapt the recommendations, for example, adding genomic data to the EHR database.Intelligent apps, the second trend, refer to virtual personal assistants (VPAs). VPAs help users with everyday tasks, for example, sorting email or answering simple questions (just as Siri\\u2122 and Cortana\\u2122 do on our smartphones). VPAs will become more available in health care in the coming year. Intelligent things, the third trend, break down into three distinct categories: robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles.In discussing health information technology trends for 2017, Health Data Management (2016) also named AI as the first trend, stating that, although AI exploded in health care in 2016, applications were typically very specialized. More general use is projected, which \\\"will mean better access to actionable intelligence.\\\" Padmanabhan (2016) echoed this notion: \\\"In 2017, we are more likely to hear terms such as 'cognitive computing' and 'artificial intelligence' \\u201e.and less likely to hear the term 'big data analytics,' which now seems to be limiting in its description of the actual work being done in advanced analytics.\\\"AI BASICSThe term artificial intelligence is not new. It dates back to the 1940s and 1950s, and Turing (1950) asked if machines can think. AI was even used in health care in the 1970s, for example, with a system called MYCIN, developed by Stanford University, that identified bacterial infections and recommended treatments (Shortliffe, 1976). MYCIN contained three components: a knowledge base created by experts, an inference engine with rule-based algorithms, and a user interface. Although there were other instances of expert system designed in that era, there was never a critical mass of users to adopt them for clinical practice. Most health care professionals did not see the need for machines to tell them how to practice.Circumstances have changed. According to the Executive Office of the President, National Science and Technology Council Committee on Technology (2016, p. 6), the current motivation for AI was \\\"driven by three mutually reinforcing factors: the availability of big data.. .dramatically improved machine learning approaches and algorithms \\u201eand the capabilities of more powerful computers.\\\"COGNTIVE COMPUTINGCognitive computing (CC) is an emerging term that some view as a subset of AI. Kelly (2016, p. 1) believes that the future oftechnology will be \\\"cognitive and not artificial\\\" and defines CC in terms of \\\"systems that learn at scale, reason with purpose and interact with humans naturally.\\\" One other distinguishing factor is that CC can handle \\\"unstructured data,\\\" whereas AI applications are typically based on structured or numeric data.

Ruano-Gallego et al. used the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium to model effector function in vivo. They found that effectors work together as a network, allowing the microbe great flexibility in maintaining pathogenicity. An artificial intelligence platform correctly predicted colonization outcomes of alternative networks from the in vivo data. However, the host was able to bypass the obstacles erected by different effector networks and activate complementary immune responses that cleared the pathogen and induced protective immunity. Science, this issue p. eabc9531 The cooperative functions of bacterial effectors form networks that can withstand network contractions and maintain pathogenicity. INTRODUCTION Infections with many Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, rely on the injection of effectors via type III secretion systems (T3SSs). The effectors hijack cellular processes through multiple mechanisms, including molecular mimicry and diverse enzymatic activities. Although in vitro analyses have shown that individual effectors can exhibit complementary, interdependent, or antagonistic relationships, most in vivo studies have focused on the contribution of single effectors to pathogenesis. Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that shares infection strategies and virulence factors with the human pathogens enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EPEC and EHEC). The ability of these pathogens to colonize the gastrointestinal tract is mediated by the injection of effectors via a T3SS. Although C. rodentium infects 31 effectors, the prototype EPEC strain E2348/69 translocates 21 effectors. RATIONALE The aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that, rather than operating individually, the T3SS effectors form robust intracellular networks that can sustain large contractions and that expanded effector repertoires play a role in distinct disease phenotypes and host adaption. RESULTS We tested the effector-network paradigm by infecting mice with >100 C. rodentium effector mutant combinations. First, using machine learning prediction algorithms, we discovered additional effectors, NleN and NleO. We then sequentially deleted effector genes from two distinct starting points to reach sustainable endpoints, which resulted in strains missing 19 unrelated effectors (CR14) or 10 effectors involved in the modulation of innate immune responses in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) (CRi9). Moreover, we deleted Map and EspF, which target the mitochondria and disrupt tight junctions. Unexpectedly, all strains colonized the colon and activated conserved metabolic and antimicrobial processes in the IECs while eliciting distinct cytokine and immune cell infiltration responses. In particular, although infection with C. rodentium \\u0394map/\\u0394espF failed to induce secretion of interleukin-22 (IL-22), CR14 and CRi9 triggered heightened secretion of IL-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and of IL-22, interferon-\\u03b3 (IFN-\\u03b3), and IL-17 from colonic explants, respectively. Nonetheless, infection with CR14 or CRi9 induced protective immunity against secondary infections. Although Tir, EspZ, and NleA are essential, other effectors exhibit context-dependent essentiality in vivo. Moreover, C. rodentium expressing the effector repertoire of EPEC E2348/69 failed to efficiently colonize mice. We used curated functional information and our in vivo data to train a machine learning model that predicted values for colonization efficiency of previously uncharacterized mutant combinations. Notably, a mutant with a low predicted value, lacking only nleF, nleG8, nleG1, nleB, and espL, failed to colonize. CONCLUSION Our analysis revealed that T3SS effectors form robust networks, which can sustain substantial contractions while maintaining virulence, and that the composition of the effector network contributes to host adaptation. Alternative effector networks within a single pathogen triggered markedly different immune responses yet induced protective immunity. CR14 did not tolerate any further contraction, which suggests that this network reached its robustness limit with only 12 effectors. As the robustness limits of other effector networks depend on the contraction starting point and the order of the deletions, machine learning models could transform our ability to predict alternative network functions. Together, this study demonstrates the robustness of T3SS effector networks and the ability of IECs to withstand drastic perturbations while maintaining antibacterial functions. T3SS effectors form robust intracellular networks. T3SS effector networks can sustain substantial contractions while maintaining virulence. Using C. rodentium as a model showed that although triggering the conserved infection signatures in IECs, distinct networks induce divergent immune responses and affect host adaption. Because the robustness limit depends on the contraction sequence, machine learning models could transform our ability to predict the virulence potential of alternative networks. Infections with many Gram-negative pathogens, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, rely on type III secretion system (T3SS) effectors. We hypothesized that while hijacking processes within mammalian cells, the effectors operate as a robust network that can tolerate substantial contractions. This was tested in vivo using the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium (encoding 31 effectors). Sequential gene deletions showed that effector essentiality for infection was context dependent and that the network could tolerate 60% contraction while maintaining pathogenicity. Despite inducing very different colonic cytokine profiles (e.g., interleukin-22, interleukin-17, interferon-\\u03b3, or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), different networks induced protective immunity. Using data from >100 distinct mutant combinations, we built and trained a machine learning model able to predict colonization outcomes, which were confirmed experimentally. Furthermore, reproducing the human-restricted enteropathogenic E. coli effector repertoire in C. rodentium was not sufficient for efficient colonization, which implicates effector networks in host adaptation. These results unveil the extreme robustness of both T3SS effector networks and host responses.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"a8f59ac02f845e7932528a28d013cbf25bdcf324\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"9cd5d98b7d3fa51e1bc7ea3c195798cbf21dc464\", \"abstract\": \"The near-term artificial intelligence, commonly referred as \\u2018weak AI\\u2019 in the last couple years was achieved thanks to the advances in machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, which has currently the best in-class performance outperforming other machine learning algorithms.

Deep learning requires large amount of data that has to be rapidly collected (also known as \\u2018big data\\u2019) in order to create robust model parameters that are able to predict future occurrences of certain event. In some domains, a large dataset such as CIFAR-10, MNIST, or Kaggle exist already.

As many computer science researchers believe, we also think that in order to achieve a performance similar to human-level intelligence, AI could and should not start from scratch. Introducing an inductive bias into deep learning might be one solution to achieve that humanlevel intelligence. In this paper, we give an example how to incorporate aerospace domain knowledge into the development of deep learning algorithms.

These sensors are various domains of networks that lead us to smart systems in healthcare, transportation, environment, and other relevant branches/networks. Having collaborative interaction among the smart systems connects end-user devices to each other which enables achieving a new integrated entity called Smart Cities. The goal of this study is to provide a comprehensive survey of data analytics in smart cities. In this paper, we aim to focus on one of the smart cities important branches, namely Smart Mobility, and its positive ample impact on the smart cities decision-making process. Intelligent decision-making systems in smart mobility offer many advantages such as saving energy, relaying city traffic, and more importantly, reducing air pollution by offering real-time useful information and imperative knowledge. Making a decision in smart cities in time is challenging due to various and high dimensional factors and parameters, which are not frequently collected.

Then, we offer a framework of these solutions, called universal smart cities decision making, with three main sections of data capturing, data analysis, and decision making to optimize the smart mobility within smart cities.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2019. 232 pages. Hardcover; $24.95. ISBN: 9780190948207. *Can an algorithm be ethical? That question appears to be similar to asking if a hammer can be ethical. Isn't the ethics solely related to how the hammer is used? Using it to build a house seems ethical; using it to harm another person would be immoral. *That line of thinking would be appropriate if the algorithm were something as simple as a sorting routine. If we sort the list of names in a wedding guest book so that the thank-you cards can be sent more systematically, its use would be acceptable; sorting a list of email addresses by education level in order to target people with a scam would be immoral. *The algorithms under consideration in The Ethical Algorithm are of a different nature, and the ethical issues are more complex. These algorithms are of fairly recent origin. They arise as we try to make use of vast collections of data to make more-accurate decisions: for example, using income, credit history, current debt level, and education level to approve or disapprove a loan application. A second example would be the use of high school GPA, ACT or SAT scores, and extra-curricular activities to determine college admissions. *The algorithms under consideration use machine-learning techniques (a branch of artificial intelligence) to look at the success rates of past student admissions and instruct the machine-learning algorithm to determine a set of criteria that successfully distinguish (with minimal errors) between those past students who graduated and those who didn't. That set of criteria (called a \\\"model\\\") can then be used to predict the success of future applicants. *The ethical component is important because such machine-learning algorithms optimize with particular goals as targets. And there tend to be unintended consequences--such as higher rates of rejection of applicants of color who would actually have succeeded. The solution to this problem requires more than just adding social equity goals as part of what is to be optimized--although that is an important step. *The authors advocate the development of precise definitions of the social goals we seek, and then the development of algorithmic techniques that help produce those goals. One important example is the social goal of privacy. What follows leaves out many important ideas found in the book, but illustrates the key points. Kearns and Roth cite the release in the mid-1990s of a dataset containing medical records for all state employees of Massachusetts. The dataset was intended for the use of medical researchers. The governor assured the employees that identifying information had been removed--names, social security numbers, and addresses. Two weeks later, Latanya Sweeney, a PhD student at MIT, sent the governor his medical records from that dataset. It cost her $20 to legally purchase the voter rolls for the city of Cambridge, MA. She then correlated that with other publicly available information to eliminate every other person from the medical dataset other than the governor himself. *Achieving data privacy is not as simple as was originally thought. To make progress, a good definition of privacy is needed. One useful definition is the notion of differential privacy: \\\"nothing about an individual should be learnable from a dataset that cannot be learned from the same dataset but with the individual's data removed\\\" (p. 36). This needs to also prevent identification by merging multiple datasets (for example, the medical records from several hospitals from which we might be able to identify an individual by looking for intersections on a few key attributes such as age, gender, and illness). One way to achieve this goal is to add randomness to the data. This can be done in a manner in which the probability of determining an individual changes very little by adding or removing that person's data to/from the dataset. *A very clever technique for adding this random noise can be found in a randomized response, an idea introduced in the 1960s to get accurate information in polls about sensitive topics (such as, \\\"have you cheated on your taxes?\\\"). The respondent is told to flip a coin. If it is a head, answer truthfully. If it is a tail, flip a second time and answer \\\"yes\\\" if it is a head and \\\"no\\\" if it is a tail. Suppose the true proportion of people who cheat on their taxes is p. Some pretty simple math shows that with a sufficiently large sample size (larger than needed for surveys that are less sensitive), the measured proportion, m, of \\\"yes\\\" responses will be close to m = \\u00bc + \\u00bd p. We can then approximate p as 2m - \\u00bd, and still give individuals reasonable deniability. If I answer \\\"yes\\\" and a hacker finds my record, there is still a 25% chance that my true answer is \\\"no.\\\" My privacy has been effectively protected. So we can achieve reasonable privacy at the cost of needing a larger dataset. *This short book discusses privacy, fairness, multiplayer games (such as using apps to direct your morning commute), pitfalls in scientific research, accountability, the singularity (a future time where machines might become \\\"smarter\\\" than humans), and more. Sufficient detail is given so that the reader can understand the ideas and the fundamental aspects of the algorithms without requiring a degree in mathematics or computer science. *One of the fundamental issues driving the need for ethical algorithms is the unintended consequences that result from well-intended choices. This is not a new phenomenon--Lot made a choice based on the data he had available: \\\"Lot looked about him, and saw that the plain of the Jordan was well watered everywhere like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt ...\\\" Genesis 13:10 (NRSV). But by choosing that apparently desirable location, Lot brought harm to his family. *I have often pondered the command of Jesus in Matthew 10:16 where he instructs us to \\\"be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.\\\" Perhaps one way to apply this command is to be wise as we are devising algorithms to make sure that they do no harm. We should be willing to give up some efficiency in order to achieve more equitable results. *Reviewed by Eric Gossett, Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Bethel University, St. Paul, MN 55112.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"91befa9bb10685d87ff0154516a594e35a55676c\", \"abstract\": \"he conference attracted 320 attendees from over 90 different academic, industrial, and government institutions.

The breast cancer dataset from University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning database system and National Cancer Institute (NCI) biological database system were used for prediction and comparative study of the data mining and statistical learning techniques. The results of the classifiers or models were mixed, logistic regression did outperform decision tree, SVM, AdaBoost, Bagging and naive Bayes algorithms based on accuracy. However, the artificial neural network showed slight improvement over logistic regression, and the decision tree resulted in slightly higher classification accuracy over AdaBoost, Bagging and naive Bayes' models in terms of accuracy. Results were mixed as to which algorithm is the most optimal model, and it appeared that the performance of each algorithm depends on the size, high dimensionality of data representation and cleanliness of the dataset.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"e355d0a9bc338660c1de467329707224f5a26065\", \"abstract\": \"Detecting quality in large unstructured datasets requires capacities far beyond the limits of human perception and communicability and, as a result, there is an emerging trend towards increasingly complex analytic solutions in data science to cope with this problem. This new trend towards analytic complexity represents a severe challenge for the principle of parsimony (Occam\\u2019s razor) in science. This review article combines insight from various domains such as physics, computational science, data engineering, and cognitive science to review the specific properties of big data. Problems for detecting data quality without losing the principle of parsimony are then highlighted on the basis of specific examples. Computational building block approaches for data clustering can help to deal with large unstructured datasets in minimized computation time, and meaning can be extracted rapidly from large sets of unstructured image or video data parsimoniously through relatively simple unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Why we still massively lack in expertise for exploiting big data wisely to extract relevant information for specific tasks, recognize patterns and generate new information, or simply store and further process large amounts of sensor data is then reviewed, and examples illustrating why we need subjective views and pragmatic methods to analyze big data contents are brought forward. The review concludes on how cultural differences between East and West are likely to affect the course of big data analytics, and the development of increasingly autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) aimed at coping with the big data deluge in the near future.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"5bcd8c5def120c19d0ef8eb04731582e4adcb9bc\", \"abstract\": \"In recent years emotion detection in text has become more popular due to its potential applications in fields such as psychology, marketing, political science, and artificial intelligence, among others.

Intelligence science is a cross-discipline that dedicates to joint research on basic theory and technology of intelligence by brain science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and others. Brain science explores the essence of brain, research on the principle and model of natural intelligence in molecular, cell and behavior level. Cognitive science studies human mental activity, such as perception, learning, memory, thinking, consciousness etc. In order to implement machine intelligence, Artificial intelligence attempts simulation, extension and expansion of human intelligence using artificial methodology and technology. The above three disciplines work together to explore new concept, new theory, new methodology. It will be successful and create a brilliant future in the 21 century. Brain science points out that perceptive lobes have special function separately, the occipital lobe processes the visual information, the temporal lobe processes auditory information, the parietal lobe processes the information from the somatic sensors. All of three lobes deal with information perceived from the physical world. Each lobe is covered with cortex where the bodies of neurons are located. Cortex consists of primary, intermediate and advanced areas at least. Information is processed in the primary area first, then is passed to intermediate and advanced areas. Comparing with computer system, the brain is the same as hardware and the mind looks like software. Most work in cognitive science assumes that the mind has mental representations analogous to computer data structures, and computational procedures similar to computational algorithms. Connectionists have proposed novel ideas to use neurons and their connections as inspirations for data structures, and neuron firing and spreading activation as inspirations for algorithms. Cognitive science then works with a complex 3-way analogy among the mind, the brain, and computers. Mind, brain, and computation can each be used to suggest new ideas about the others. There is no single computational model of mind, since different kinds of computers and programming approaches suggest different ways in which the mind might work. The mind contains perception, rational, consciousness and emotion. The long-term scientific goal of artificial intelligence is human-level intelligence. In this lecture, we will discuss basic research topics related to intelligence science, such as learning, memory, thought, language, consciousness etc. We also report the recent progresses containing: visual perception; introspective learning; linguistic cognition; consciousness model; and platform of agent-grid intelligence\"}, {\"paperId\": \"573e8ff895c5771bc348265872ebf351e18109a1\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"f9c6ebb10cb3d346ea644b479715bc80a310511d\", \"abstract\": \"Biopharmaceutical industry R&D, and indeed other Life Sciences R&D such as agri-food, is data-driven and can significantly improve its efficiency and effectiveness by implementing the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship.

Visualization is particularly important with challenging data from cutting-edge experimental techniques, such as 3D genomics, spatial transcriptomics, 3D proteomics, epiproteomics, high-throughput imaging, and metagenomics. Data visualization also plays an increasing role in how research is communicated. Some scientists still think of data visualization as optional; however, as more realize it is an essential tool for revealing insights buried in complex data, bioinformatics visualization is emerging as a subdiscipline. This article outlines current and future grand challenges in bioinformatics data visualization, and announces the first publication venue dedicated to this subdiscipline. Over the past two decades, life science data have increased rapidly in volume and complexity, with the result that data analysis is often the major bottleneck (O\\u2019Donoghue et al., 2010a). For example, \\u201cAll major genomics breakthroughs so far have been accompanied by the development of groundbreaking statistical and computational methods\\u201d (Green et al., 2020). Thus, in the remaining decades of the 21st century, life scientists will become increasingly reliant on the emerging tools and methods of data science (Blei and Smyth, 2017; Altman and Levitt, 2018). One of these methods is data visualization (a.k.a. DataVis), which plays a critical role in transforming data and analysis outcomes into insight (Card et al., 1999). Data visualization involves analysis, design, and rendering, as well as observation and cognitive processing (Figure 1). Some scientists think of DataVis as an optional step mostly aimed at aesthetics \\u2014 however, there is growing recognition that it is an essential tool in the analysis of complex data; two indicators of this recognition are the recent sales of DataVis companies Looker and Tableau for US$3B and $16B, respectively. Currently, however, most attention is focused on another aspect of data science, namely, the use of machine learning to develop artificial intelligence systems. Such systems have recently led to exciting advances in the life sciences (e.g., Callaway, 2020a)\\u2014 but also to some hyperbole. Clearly, machine learning methods are increasingly critical for research; but these methods also have limitations (Challen et al., 2019; Heaven, 2019; Yu and Kohane, 2019). More fundamentally, automated methods are insufficient, since analysis outcomes must be observed and understood by an analyst before insight can occur (Figure 1). Most analysts use data visualization as an integral part of their cognitive processes\\u2014especially important is manual validation, which involves checking for errors and outliers in raw data, and for wrong assumptions used in automated analysis methods (Anscombe, 1973).

Approximate algorithms are necessary for graph matching due to its NP-complete nature. Inspired by the usage in network-related tasks, random walk is generalized to graph matching as a type of approximate algorithm. However, it may be inappropriate for the previous random walk-based graph matching algorithms to utilize continuous techniques without considering the discrete property. In this paper, we propose a novel random walk-based graph matching algorithm by incorporating both continuous and discrete constraints in the optimization process. Specifically, after interpreting graph matching by random walk, the continuous constraints are directly embedded in the random walk constraint in each iteration. Further, both the assignment matrix (vector) and the pairwise similarity measure between graphs are iteratively updated according the discrete constraints, which automatically leads the continuous solution to the discrete domain. Comparisons on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"528ccd8ddb58cd676fd427a10e255476d1e8a985\", \"abstract\": \"The series \\\"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing\\\" contains publications on theory, applications, and design methods of Intelligent Systems and Intelligent Computing.

Studies in gait and human movement sciences, therefore, play a significant role in maintaining the well-being of our mobility. Current gait analysis involves numerous interdependent gait parameters that are difficult to adequately interpret due to the large volume of recorded data and lengthy assessment times in gait laboratories. A proposed solution to these problems is computational intelligence (CI), which is an emerging paradigm in biomedical engineering most notably in pathology detection and prosthesis design. The integration of CI technology in gait systems facilitates studies in disorders caused by lower limb defects, cerebral disorders, and aging effects by learning data relationships through a combination of signal processing and machine learning techniques. Learning paradigms, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and fuzzy and evolutionary algorithms, provide advanced modeling capabilities for biomechanical systems that in the past have relied heavily on statistical analysis. CI offers the ability to investigate nonlinear data relationships, enhance data interpretation, design more efficient diagnostic methods, and extrapolate model functionality. These are envisioned to result in more cost-effective, efficient, and easy-to-use systems, which would address global shortages in medical personnel and rising medical costs.

Why does this matter? Because the IAT has predictive value in uncovering the association between concepts, such as pleasantness and flowers or unpleasantness and insects.

We replicated a spectrum of known biases, as measured by the Implicit Association Test, using a widely used, purely statistical machine-learning model trained on a standard corpus of text from the World Wide Web. Our results indicate that text corpora contain recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases, whether morally neutral as toward insects or flowers, problematic as toward race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names.

Tremendous efforts have been made to develop a wide range of computational models. However, recent studies have revealed that many widely-applied graph mining models could suffer from potential discrimination. Fairness on graph mining aims to develop strategies in order to mitigate bias introduced/amplified during the mining process. The unique challenges of enforcing fairness on graph mining include (1) theoretical challenge on non-IID nature of graph data, which may invalidate the basic assumption behind many existing studies in fair machine learning, and (2) algorithmic challenge on the dilemma of balancing model accuracy and fairness. This tutorial aims to (1) present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques in fairness on graph mining and (2) identify the open challenges and future trends. In particular, we start with reviewing the background, problem definitions, unique challenges and related problems; then we will focus on an in-depth overview of (1) recent techniques in enforcing group fairness, individual fairness and other fairness notions in the context of graph mining, and (2) future directions in studying algorithmic fairness on graphs. We believe this tutorial could be attractive to researchers and practitioners in areas including data mining, artificial intelligence, social science and beneficial to a plethora of real-world application domains.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"94ff21888cc1b38c55270ed225524ce8770a7853\", \"abstract\": \"Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. SI systems are typically made up of a population of simple agents interacting locally with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems. The agents follow very simple rules, and although there is no centralized control structure dictating how individual agents should behave, local, and to a certain degree random, interactions between such agents lead to the emergence of \\u201cintelligent\\u201d global behavior, unknown to the individual agents. Natural examples of SI include ant colonies, bird flocking, animal herding, bacterial growth, and fish schooling. \\n \\nResearch in SI started in the late 1980s. Besides the applications to conventional optimization problems, SI can be employed in library materials acquisition, communications, medical dataset classification, dynamic control, heating system planning, moving objects tracking, and prediction. Indeed, SI can be applied to a variety of fields in fundamental research, engineering, industries, and social sciences. \\n \\nThe main objective of this special issue is to provide the readers with a collection of high quality research articles that address the broad challenges in application aspects of swarm intelligence and reflect the emerging trends in state-of-the-art algorithms. \\n \\nThe special issue received 42 high quality submissions from different countries all over the world. All submitted papers followed the same standard (peer-reviewed by at least three independent reviewers) as applied to regular submissions to \\u201cthis journal\\u201d. Due to the limited space, 15 papers were finally included. The primary guideline was to demonstrate the wide scope of SI algorithms and applications in various aspects. Besides, mathematically oriented papers with promising potential in practical problems were also included. \\n \\nThe paper authored by Y.-L. Wu et al. (National Chiao Tung University and Ming Chuan University) presents an integer programming model of the studied problem by considering how to select materials in order to maximize the average preference and the budget execution rate under some practical restrictions including departmental budget and limitation of the number of materials in each category and each language. They propose a discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) with scout particles, design an initialization algorithm and a penalty function to cope with the constraints, and employ the scout particles to enhance the exploration within the solution space. \\n \\nIn the paper by Z. Yin et al. (Harbin Institute of Technology), they propose an efficient multiuser detector based on a suboptimal code mapping multiuser detector and artificial bee colony algorithm (SCM-ABC-MUD) and implement the proposed algorithm in direct-sequence ultrawideband (DS-UWB) systems under the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. \\n \\nM. S. Uzer et al. (Selcuk University) offer a hybrid approach that uses the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm for feature selection and support vector machines for classification. For the diagnosis of hepatitis, liver disorders, and diabetes datasets from the UCI database, the proposed system reached classification accuracies of 94.92%, 74.81%, and 79.29%, respectively. \\n \\nAnother paper is by M. Karakose (Firat University) and U. Cigdem (Gaziosmanpasa University). It proposes a new approach for improvement of DNA computing with adaptive parameters towards the desired goal using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO). Experimental results obtained with MATLAB and FPGA demonstrate ability to provide effective optimization, considerable convergence speed, and high accuracy according to DNA computing algorithm. \\n \\nIn the paper by Y. Celik (Karamanoglu Mehmetbey University) and E. Ulker (Selcuk University), their research proposes an improved marriage in honey bees optimization (IMBO) by adding Levy flight algorithm for queen mating flight and neighboring for worker drone improving. The IMBO algorithm's performance and its success are tested on the well-known six unconstrained test functions and compared with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms. \\n \\nM. Baygin (Ardahan University) and M. Karakose (Firat University) study a new approach of immune system-based optimal estimate for dynamic control of group elevator systems. The method is mainly based on estimation of optimal way by optimizing all calls with genetic, immune system and DNA computing algorithms, and it is evaluated with a fuzzy system. With dynamic and adaptive control approach in this study, a significant progress on group elevator control systems has been achieved in terms of time and energy efficiency according to traditional methods. \\n \\nThe paper by M. Karakose (Firat University) proposes a reinforcement-learning based artificial immune classifier. The proposed new approach has many contributions according to other methods in the literature such as effectiveness, less memory cell, high accuracy, speed, and data adaptability. Some benchmark data and remote image data are used for experimental results. The comparative results with supervised/unsupervised based artificial immune system, negative selection classifier, and resource limited artificial immune classifier are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new method. \\n \\nIn their paper, T. J. Choi et al. (Sungkyunkwan University) and (Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology) present an adaptive parameter control DE algorithm. The control parameters of each individual are adapted based on the average of successfully evolved individuals' parameter values using the Cauchy distribution. The experimental results show that their proposed algorithm is more robust than the standard DE algorithm and several state-of-the-art adaptive DE algorithms in solving various unimodal and multimodal problems. \\n \\nIn the paper by R.-J. Ma et al. (Southwest Jiaotong University and CSR Qishuyan Institute Co., Ltd.), the authors present an integral mathematical model and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on the life cycle cost (LCC) approach for the heating system planning (HSP) problem. The results show that the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm can more preferably solve the HSP problem than PSO algorithm. \\n \\nIn the paper by M. Tang et al. (National University of Defense Technology and Universite Pierre et Marie Curie), they report that the flocking has some negative effects on the human, as the infectious disease H7N9 will easily be transmitted from the denser flocking birds to the human. Their paper focuses on the H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and from the flocking birds to the human. Some interesting results have been shown: (1) only some simple rules could result in an emergence such as the flocking; (2) the minimum distance between birds could affect H7N9 virus transmission in the flocking birds and even affect the virus transmissions from the flocking birds to the human. \\n \\nY. Wang et al. (China University of Petroleum) present a memory-based multiagent coevolution algorithm for robust tracking the moving objects. Each agent can remember, retrieve, or forget the appearance of the object through its own memory system by its own experience. Experimental results show that their proposed method can deal with large appearance changes and heavy occlusions when tracking a moving object. \\n \\nThe paper by Q. Ni and J. Deng (Southeast University and Soochow University) analyzes the performance of PSO with the proposed random topologies and explores the relationship between population topology and the performance of PSO from the perspective of graph theory characteristics in population topologies. Further, in a relatively new PSO variant which named logistic dynamic particle optimization, an extensive simulation study is presented to discuss the effectiveness of the random topology and the design strategies of population topology. \\n \\nY. Zhou and H. Zheng (Guangxi University for Nationalities, Guangxi Key Laboratory of Hybrid Computation and IC Design Analysis) propose a novel complex valued cuckoo search algorithm. They use complex-valued encoding to expand the information of nest individuals and denote the gene of individuals by plurality. The value of independent variables for objective function is determined by modules, and a sign of them is determined by angles. The position of nest is divided into real part gene and imaginary gene. Six typical functions are tested, and the usefulness of the proposed algorithm is verified. \\n \\nThe paper by R. Alwee et al. (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia) introduces a hybrid model that combines support vector regression (SVR) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to be applied in crime rates forecasting. Particle swarm optimization is used to estimate the parameters of the SVR and ARIMA models. The experimental results show that their proposed hybrid model is able to produce more accurate forecasting results as compared to the individual models. \\n \\nFinally, K. S. Lim et al. (Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Universiti Malaysia Pahang, and University of Malaya) describe an improved Vector Evaluated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm by incorporating the nondominated solutions as the guidance for a swarm rather than using the best solution from another swarm. The results suggest that the improved Vector Evaluated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm has impressive performance compared with the conventional Vector Evaluated Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"5b5d6867e7a69cae38003c0c6fcb4c621f8d4af4\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"8467534990215ef80b005bc9e4df5a1a2b2e7745\", \"abstract\": \"Data Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies, Second Edition uses practical examples to illustrate the power of R and data mining.

There is no human shortcut to building this intuition; chemists hone their skills through years of experience of learning and memorizing patterns of molecular structure and reactivity. It is in this spirit that Vijay Pande and co-workers propose in \\u201cLow Data Drug Discovery with One-Shot Learning\\u201d in this issue of ACS Central Science a computational approach for chemical prediction by learning from a low number of examples. The paper touches on many central themes that are relevant to the intersection of the three main components of computation in chemistry: molecular representation, chemical space exploration, and machine learning to accelerate computation. For discovering new molecules, the enormity of chemical space cannot be understated; the number of \\u201csmall\\u201d to \\u201cmedium\\u201d sized molecules is estimated to be in the range of 10 to 10180, a number that is a hundred orders of magnitude larger than the number of atoms in the visible universe. With just a considerably small number of examples, chemists are able to distinguish and assess the potential function of a molecule for a given task. For example, we recently created a \\u201cMolecular Tinder\\u201d application that helped us in the design of molecules for organic displays. In analogy to the dating application, Molecular Tinder was a voting system that allowed us to harvest information from experimentalists who voted \\u201cYes\\u201d, \\u201cNo\\u201d, or \\u201cMaybe\\u201d on the synthesizability of molecules. Voting results allowed us to design algorithms that preferentially generated molecules with practical synthesic routes that were eventually synthesized and tested in real devices. Another very important aspect of human intuition is \\u201ctransferability\\u201d, which enables the generalization of knowledge learned in a particular domain to untested domains. Everyone who has passed an undergraduate organic chemistry test had to show that their brain is able to generalize from one domain to the other. This is a much more challenging task for a computer. We are sometimes able to predict with varying degrees of success these properties using quantum chemistry calculations, but when these simulations are involved, supralinear computational scaling laws hinder the application of most common algorithms to complex molecules. Therefore, to cover chemical space efficiently, we cannot go unaided by intuition if we ever hope to explore it for successful molecular design. It is often thought in the artificial intelligence (AI) community that any human decision that can be done in a matter of a few seconds, can be in theory, learned and automated by a computer. There have been many recent examples where deep learning is solving increasingly complex tasks and getting closer to the performance of humans, even surpassing it in certain tasks such as the game Go with AlphaGo.

The onset of the term Industry 5.0 is observed to have various views of how it is defined and what constitutes the reconciliation between humans and machines.

To further enhance the science reach of this emergent field, there is a pressing need to increase the depth and speed of the gravitational wave algorithms that have enabled these groundbreaking discoveries. To contribute to this effort, we introduce Deep Filtering, a new highly scalable method for end-to-end time-series signal processing, based on a system of two deep convolutional neural networks, which we designed for classification and regression to rapidly detect and estimate parameters of signals in highly noisy time-series data streams. We demonstrate a novel training scheme with gradually increasing noise levels, and a transfer learning procedure between the two networks. We showcase the application of this method for the detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Our results indicate that Deep Filtering significantly outperforms conventional machine learning techniques, achieves similar performance compared to matched-filtering while being several orders of magnitude faster thus allowing real-time processing of raw big data with minimal resources. More importantly, Deep Filtering extends the range of gravitational wave signals that can be detected with ground-based gravitational wave detectors.

Artificial systems used to study imitation can both test models of imitation derived from observational or neurobiological data on imitation in animals and then apply them to different kinds of nonbiological systems ranging from robots to software agents. A crucial problem in imitation is the correspondence problem, mapping action sequences of the demonstrator and the imitator agent.

Data mining and usage of the useful patterns that reside in the databases have become a very important research area because of the rapid developments in both computer hardware and software industries. In parallel with the rapid increase in the data stored in the databases, effective use of the data is becoming a problem. To discover the rules or interesting and useful patterns from these stored data, data mining techniques are used. If data is incomplete or inaccurate, the results extracted from the database during the data discovery phase would be inconsistent and meaningless. Rough sets theory is a new mathematical approach used in the intelligent data analysis and data mining if data is uncertain or incomplete. This approach is of great importance in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, especially in machine learning, decision analysis, expert systems and inductive reasoning. There are many advantages of rough set approach in intelligent data analysis. Some of these advantages are being suitable for parallel processing, finding minimal data sets, supplying effective algorithms to discover hidden patterns in data, valuation of the meaningfulness of the data, producing decision rule set from data, being easy to understand and the results obtained can be interpreted clearly. In the last years, rough sets theory is widely used in different areas like engineering, banking and finance.

Yet its importance has grown in the information access community because of two complementing factors: on one hand, it is relatively difficult to precisely point to the source of a piece of information, and on the other hand, complex algorithms, statistical machine learning, artificial intelligence, make decisions on behalf of the users, with little oversight from the users themselves.This survey presents a detailed analysis of existing credibility models from different information seeking research areas, with focus on the Web and its pervasive social component. It shows that there is a very rich body of work pertaining to different aspects and interpretations of credibility, particularly for different types of textual content e.g., Web sites, blogs, tweets, but also to other modalities videos, images, audio and topics e.g., health care. After an introduction placing credibility in the context of other sciences and relating it to trust, we argue for a quartic decomposition of credibility: expertise and trustworthiness, well documented in the literature and predominantly related to information source, and quality and reliability, raised to the status of equal partners because the source is often impossible to detect, and predominantly related to the content.The second half of the survey provides the reader with access points to the literature, grouped by research interests. Section 3 reviews general research directions: the factors that contribute to credibility assessment in human consumers of information; the models used to combine these factors; the methods to predict credibility. A smaller section is dedicated to informing users about the credibility learned from the data. Sections 4, 5, and 6 go further into details, with domain-specific credibility, social media credibility, and multimedia credibility, respectively. While each of them is best understood in the context of Sections 1 and 2, they can be read independently of each other.The last section of this survey addresses a topic not commonly considered under \\\"credibility\\\": the credibility of the system itself, independent of the data creators. This is a topic of particular importance in domains where the user is professionally motivated and where there are no concerns about the credibility of the data e.g. e-discovery and patent search.

Despite the ongoing efforts to improve feature learning, handcrafted extraction still plays a very important role. In this context, a careful choice of features is extremely relevant for creating an accurate classification.

They have been used to represent the meaning of various units of natural languages, including, among others, words, phrases, and sentences. Before the deep learning tsunami, count-based vector space models had been successfully used in computational linguistics to represent the semantics of natural languages. However, the rise of neural networks in NLP popularized the use of word embeddings, which are now applied as pre-trained vectors in most machine learning architectures. This book, written by Mohammad Taher Pilehvar and Jose Camacho-Collados, provides a comprehensive and easy-to-read review of the theory and advances in vector models for NLP, focusing specially on semantic representations and their applications. It is a great introduction to different types of embeddings and the background and motivations behind them. In this sense, the authors adequately present the most relevant concepts and approaches that have been used to build vector representations. They also keep track of the most recent advances of this vibrant and fast-evolving area of research, discussing cross-lingual representations and current language models based on the Transformer. Therefore, this is a useful book for researchers interested in computational methods for semantic representations and artificial intelligence. Although some basic knowledge of machine learning may be necessary to follow a few topics, the book includes clear illustrations and explanations, which make it accessible to a wide range of readers. Apart from the preface and the conclusions, the book is organized into eight chapters. In the first two, the authors introduce some of the core ideas of NLP and artificial neural networks, respectively, discussing several concepts that will be useful throughout the book. Then, Chapters 3 to 6 present different types of vector representations at the lexical level (word embeddings, graph embeddings, sense embeddings, and contextualized embeddings), followed by a brief chapter (7) about sentence and document embeddings. For each specific topic, the book includes methods and data sets to assess the quality of the embeddings.

It is similar to the human vision system, as it enables computers to recognize and process objects in pictures and videos in the same way as humans do. Computer vision technology has rapidly evolved in many fields and contributed to solving many problems, as computer vision contributed to self-driving cars, and cars were able to understand their surroundings. The cameras record video from different angles around the car, then a computer vision system gets images from the video, and then processes the images in real-time to find roadside ends, detect other cars, and read traffic lights, pedestrians, and objects.

Deep learning algorithm perform a task repeatedly, each time tweak it a little to improve the outcome. So, the development of computer vision was due to deep learning. Now we'll take a tour around the convolution neural networks, let us say that convolutional neural networks are one of the most powerful supervised deep learning models (abbreviated as CNN or ConvNet). This name ;convolutional ; is a token from a mathematical linear operation between matrixes called convolution. CNN structure can be used in a variety of real-world problems including, computer vision, image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), anomaly detection, video analysis, drug discovery, recommender systems, health risk assessment, and time-series forecasting. If we look at convolutional neural networks, we see that CNN are similar to normal neural networks, the only difference between CNN and ANN is that CNNs are used in the field of pattern recognition within images mainly. This allows us to encode the features of an image into the structure, making the network more suitable for image-focused tasks, with reducing the parameters required to set-up the model. One of the advantages of CNN that it has an excellent performance in machine learning problems. So, we will use CNN as a classifier for image classification.

This paper proposes a novel deep clustering method for this challenging task. Aiming at the dynamical clustering at feature-level, we introduce extra constraints hidden in the geometric structure between data to assist the process. Concretely, we propose a geometry-based constraint, named semantic consistency on the nearest neighborhood (SCNNH), and use it to encourage robust clustering. To reach this goal, we construct the nearest neighborhood for every target data and take it as the fundamental clustering unit by building our objective on the geometry. Also, we develop a more SCNNH-compliant structure with an additional semantic credibility constraint, named semantic hyper-nearest neighborhood (SHNNH). After that, we extend our method to this new geometry. Extensive experiments on three challenging UDA datasets indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

Hazardous failures are rare events; the set of variate values of the number of such events for an individual kilometre of track per year is: [0, 1]. However, for a railway network as a whole the yearly number of such events is in the dozens and efficient management requires the transition from the estimation of the probability of hazardous failure occurrence to the identification of the most probable location of failure. Methods . The problem of identification of rare, but hazardous possible events out of hundreds of thousands of records of non-critical railway track parameter divergences cannot be solved by conventional means of statistical processing. Hazardous events are predicted using the above statistics and artificial intelligence. Big Data and Data Science technology is used. Such technology includes methods of machine learning that enable item classification based on characteristics (features, predicates) and known cases of undesired event occurrence. The application of various algorithms of machine learning is demonstrated using the example of prediction of track superstructure failures using records collected between 2014 and 2019 on the Kuybyshevskaya Railway. Findings and conclusions . The result of facility ranking is the conclusion regarding the location of the most probable hazardous failure of railway track. That conclusion is based on the correspondence analysis between the actual characteristics of an item and conditions of its operation and the cases of adverse events and cases of their non-occurrence. The practical value of this paper consists in the fact that the proposed set of methods and means can be considered as an integral part of the track maintenance decision-making system.

New Challenges to the Social Sciences 7 Development of Technologies in the Field of Artificial Intelligence \\u2013 Responsibility and Challenges in Social Context For many years scientists and experts from virtually all scientific fields have been discussing the relationship between human and technology, which is developing at an increasing rate. These considerations include not only new ways of learning or human reaction to resulting changes in the reality, but also possible social processes which occur or will occur in the future due to technologisation and increasing presence of machines and robots in everyday life. The challenge which social science researchers face is the application of various calculation methods and new technologies to make quicker and easier decisions in social contexts with regard to various groups of people, e.g. employees, customers, or voters. This allows to gather data faster and identify digital traces of human activity \\u2013 either in social networks or in information obtained during behavioural studies using mobile phones. Access to this type of data provides the ability to stimulate various behaviours. Specialised software used on this kind of data has been perfected at an increasingly fast rate since the 1990s towards study of methods of AI operation. Initially, data compilation software was created to build databases using a specific type of reasoning mechanisms. Nearly 70 years have passed since the first widely recognised definition of artificial intelligence was presented by Alan Turing in 1950. At the time, artificial intelligence was understood, for the purpose of the conducted experiment, as an ability of a machine to perform cognitive tasks effectively without making human interrogator realise that that the respondent is a machine (Turing, 1950). Nowadays, programmers are focused on the creation of intelligent behaviour patterns which may be utilised in computer software. The goal is to develop a model allowing machine to imitate sophisticated human manifestations of intelligence: making decisions under uncertainty, analysis and synthesis of natural languages, conducting logical reasoning, diagnosis, expertise and participation in logic-based games such as chess. Machines already have achieved the ability to learn and perfect their behaviour on the basis of new experience. Using algorithms and specific data, the machines can, through the process of induction, transition from supervised learning to unsupervised learning (Russell & Norvig, 2003). More and more often, people are being replaced by machines, devices, and appropriate software, all through learning specific forms of response based on the output data. Nowadays, the ethical question should be a top priority for scientists, because many people might be really hurt by these algorithms (Suchacka & Hor\\u00e1kov\\u00e1, 2019, p. 917). Ma\\u0142gorzata Suchacka 8 This has specific consequences \\u2013 chances and threats. At the threshold of revolution initiated by introduction of artificial intelligence into various areas of socioeconomic life, an increasing number of socially sensitive practitioners and scientists call for the need to create a complex strategy of AI development. The analysis of selected AI development programmes conducted by Digital Poland Foundation in 2018 points to differences in approach to this matter between various countries. Depending on the government\\u2019s policy, emphasis is placed on retaining scientific leadership and development of basic research around AI (France), ensuring national security, order and monitoring behaviour of the citizens (China), maintaining leadership in robotics, increasing the level of industrialisation and supporting ageing society (Japan). The report characterises world\\u2019s most prominent centres of innovation and highlights the need to promote economy based on knowledge, cooperation, and sharing experience with the support of the regional and national level authorities (Digital Poland Foundation, 2018). The aware and responsible decision-makers should create conditions favourable for close integration of the worlds of science and business and accelerated commercialisation of the results of their cooperation. The responsibility of the elites and scientific authorities should consist in raising awareness about AI and taking the new phenomenon seriously. Potential threats may completely change our civilisation. The research conducted on the matter is still focused primarily on technical and IT issues, despite the fact that great minds of our times like Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Stephen Hawking have been warning us against development of a model of artificial intelligence able to continuously improve itself. It is difficult to image what is becoming the reality \\u2013 machine surpassing human. The most controversial is the use of artificial intelligence in the army [armed forces], from rockets or jets to all kinds of infrastructure control systems. At this stage, it is assumed that people are in control, not threatened by computers deciding anything themselves. It will be this way until the artificial intelligence begins to modify its goals. Even if it is possible for the machine to become self-conscious, it will still have to set tasks for itself and find a justification for them, and that part is not immediately obvious. At the moment, intelligent technologies assist us with acquiring knowledge quickly, learning new behaviors outside the traditional system of education, which, however, should not be completely eliminated. A constant reflection, inherently sociological, should accompany these technological changes, for the algorithms behind ethical actions are the very traits of humanity and it is quite difficult to assume that the machine will accept them or will develop them itself without error of proper access path (Suc\"}, {\"paperId\": \"cc2a5a9d07e46484422cc7628486f31f4b2fe074\", \"abstract\": \"Adaptive and Natural Computing AlgorithmsAdvances in Knowledge Discovery and Data MiningLectures on Gaussian ProcessesAn introduction to continuity and related topics for general Gaussian ProcessesLarge Deviations for Gaussian QueuesGaussian Markov Random FieldsAsymptotic Methods in the Theory of Gaussian Processes and FieldsModelling and Control of Dynamic Systems Using Gaussian Process ModelsAn Introduction to Continuity, Extrema, and Related Topics for General Gaussian ProcessesThe Gaussian Approximation PotentialAn Introduction to Continuity, Extrema, and Related Topics for General Gaussian ProcessesStochastic Analysis for Gaussian Random Processes and FieldsMachine LearningNeural Networks and Machine LearningBayesian Time Series ModelsGraphical Models for Machine Learning and Digital CommunicationMarkov Processes, Gaussian Processes, and Local TimesThe Generic ChainingTime Series AnalysisProbability in Banach SpacesDark DataMachine LearningSurrogatesIntroduction and Implementations of the Kalman FilterMachine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in DatabasesLearning Kernel ClassifiersThe Concentration of Measure PhenomenonBayesian Data Analysis, Third EditionKernels for Vector-Valued FunctionsAdvanced Lectures on Machine LearningGaussian Processes for Machine LearningEfficient Reinforcement Learning Using Gaussian ProcessesGaussian Process Regression Analysis for Functional DataGaussian Processes on TreesBayesian Learning for Neural NetworksReinforcement Learning and Optimal ControlInterpolation of Spatial DataQuantum Processes Systems, and InformationHigh-Dimensional ProbabilityIntroduction to Empirical Processes and Semiparametric Inference The three volume proceedings LNAI 11906 \\u2013 11908 constitutes the refereed proceedings of the European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, ECML PKDD 2019, held in W\\u00fcrzburg, Germany, in September 2019.

Chapter \\\"Incorporating Dependencies in Spectral Kernels for Gaussian Processes\\\" is available open access under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License via link.springer.com.This book is devoted to a systematic analysis of asymptotic behavior of distributions of various typical functionals of Gaussian random variables and fields. The text begins with an extended introduction, which explains fundamental ideas and sketches the basic methods fully presented later in the book. Good approximate formulas and sharp estimates of the remainders are obtained for a large class of Gaussian and similar processes. The author devotes special attention to the development of asymptotic analysis methods, emphasizing the method of comparison, the double-sum method and the method of moments. The author has added an extended introduction and has significantly revised the text for this translation, particularly the material on the double-sum method.This monograph opens up new horizons for engineers and researchers in academia and in industry dealing with or interested in new developments in the field of system identification and control. It emphasizes guidelines for working solutions and practical advice for their implementation rather than the theoretical background of Gaussian process (GP) models. The book demonstrates the potential of this recent development in probabilistic machine-learning methods and gives the reader an intuitive understanding of the topic. The current state of the art is treated along with possible future directions for research. Systems control design relies on mathematical models and these may be developed from measurement data. This process of system identification, when based on GP models, can play an integral part of control design in data-based control and its description as such is an essential aspect of the text. The background of GP regression is introduced first with system identification and incorporation of prior knowledge then leading into full-blown control. The book is illustrated by extensive use of examples, line drawings, and graphical presentation of computer-simulation results and plant measurements. The research results presented are applied in real-life case studies drawn from successful applications including: a gas\\u2013liquid separator control; urban-traffic signal modelling and reconstruction; and prediction of atmospheric ozone concentration. A MATLAB\\u00ae toolbox, for identification and simulation of dynamic GP models is provided for download.Sensor data fusion is the process of combining error-prone, heterogeneous, incomplete, and ambiguous data to gather a higher level of situational awareness. In principle, all living creatures are fusing information from their complementary senses to coordinate their actions and to detect and localize danger. In sensor data fusion, this process is transferred to electronic systems, which rely on some \\\"awareness\\\" of what is happening in certain areas of interest. By means of probability theory and statistics, it is possible to model the relationship between the state space and the sensor data. The number of ingredients of the resulting Kalman filter is limited, but its applications are not.Kosorok\\u2019s brilliant text provides a self-contained introduction to empirical processes and semiparametric inference. These powerful research techniques are surprisingly useful for developing methods of statistical inference for complex models and in understanding the properties of such methods.

LAD is a supervised learning, artificial intelligence, data mining technique that possesses distinctive advantages which proved to be of use in PAHM. This approach has been introduced by a group of researchers at Rutgers University in the USA, in the medical field, and it was adapted and used in the field of PAHM for the first time by our group of researchers. Unlike the traditional approaches that are either based on mathematical and statistical models or neural network modelling, this approach is based only on the advancement in the field of computer science, namely the speed of computation and the volume of data that can be processed, and proceeds in a logical manner like the human brain. That is why its potential for future applications seems promising. LAD does not assume that the data belong to a specific statistical distribution and therefore does not require statistical analysis of data prior to or after its use. Unlike the statistically based techniques, correlations and dependence between features or variables do not have any effect on LAD's per formance. LAD can handle this phenomenon, and moreover, it gives physical explanation to it. Unlike other data analysis techniques, such as neural networks and support vector machines, LAD is a transparent method; the output of LAD can be traced back to the specific root causes that resulted in the categorization of a specific observation into a certain class. The interpretability of all the results and of all the steps of calculation is a clear advantage that maintenance experts can use in order to find answers to their questions. LAD detects and diagnoses complex phenomena such as equipment fault due to the interaction of multiple factors. Moreover, LAD is not based and does not need data on failure events. Thus, for physical assets that have a lifetime of 25 or 30 years, degradation can still be analyzed and maintenance decision can still be taken. During the learning process, LAD analyzes the collected data that represents readings of some physical asset's features such as vibration signals, oil analysis, temperature, etc..., which are taken while the asset is in different states, for example new, failing, deteriorating, etc... It then generates patterns that can be easily interpreted and translated into meaningful physical rules. LAD automatically extracts features and generates patterns from the readings and, accordingly, classifies the asset into a certain state based on the patterns generated. The learning function of cbmLAD results in an accumulation and preservation of expert knowledge that can be used at any time by the user, even if the human expertise is lost due to retirement or resignation. It thus becomes a powerful knowledge management tool that automates and conserves knowledge. In the testing process LAD can detect and diagnose the asset's state based on the generated knowledge during the learning process. This process of learning and pattern generation serve to reinforce the theoretical knowledge and uncover new knowledge about a certain diagnostic problem in PAHM. LAD has been applied successful in different situations that will be presented in the following sections.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"02c989cba99e41da3b79245ba6fc6bce7af5e45a\", \"abstract\": \"Abstract Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants.

We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1\\u20134), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant\\u2010based medicines, and \\\"green infrastructure.\\\" Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a \\\"parts store\\\" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid\\u2010response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non\\u2010invasive imaging, sensors, and plug\\u2010and\\u2010play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence\\u2010assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship. This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"46fd480d4866c8081b668584ffa4c6bb07df92f5\", \"abstract\": \"Studies on human mobility have a long history with increasingly strong interdisciplinary connections across social science, environmental science, information and technology, computer science, engineering, and health science.

Security data visualization can be used in many areas in information security. Security metrics, Security monitoring, anomaly detection, forensics, and malware analysis are examples where security data visualization can play a vital role and make us better security professionals. Security data visualization also plays key role in emerging fields such as data science, machine learning, and exploratory data analytics. There are many uses for security data visualization; so, in order to cover key aspects the paper is categorized in to two parts. The first category is communicating value. There is a well-known proverb \\u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\\u201d (Piqua Leader-Dispatch, One Look Is Worth A Thousand Words, 1913, p. 2) which explains this. The problem with traditional metrics is numbers and tables can be daunting and details can be missed easily. Visualizing it will enable the security team to highlight the salient points in the data. Security data visualization enables you to tell a story with the data. Information security is becoming a common topic in boardroom discussions and it is becoming more and more important that the value of information security is communicated to business leaders. The second category is finding anomalies using security data visualization. One of the key strengths of security teams is access to enterprise log data, meta-data, network traffic data, and netflow data. The challenge is finding and isolating the bad actors from legitimate traffic. The human mind, by evolution, is trained to identify patterns and anomalies using visualization. Security professionals can benefit by visualizing enterprise data to find anomalies and identify patterns which will be helpful in isolating events which might indicate compromise. Hopefully some of the examples will be useful to generate more ideas in this space and will be a valuable resource for all Information Security practitioners. Once security professionals get an understanding of using security data visualization it will open a whole new world and there is a possibility that this knowledge of security data science will have significant improvement on information security tasks. Security Data Visualization pingbalaji@gmail.com 1.0 Introduction Security data visualization can be used in many areas in information security. Security metrics, Security monitoring, anomaly detection, forensics, and malware analysis are examples where security data visualization can play a vital role and make us better security professionals. Till now security professionals were able to survive with Microsoft Excel and similar tools without in-depth knowledge in security data visualization. But security data visualization is becoming extremely important due to big data, machine learning and exploratory data analytics. Due to the volume of data in big data it is extremely impossible to find anomalies using traditional methods. First thing to do after a statistical computation is to understand the data visually. Recent generations of SIEM log collection and correlation solutions use big data analytics. Security data visualization plays a very vital part in analyzing the big data. Data science field is evolving at a rapid pace. Data visualization is important component of data science. Botnet Visualization Microsoft\\u2019s Digital Crimes Unit tapped The Office for Creative Research, a multidisciplinary digital design group based in New York, to come up with new ways of looking at one particular threat: botnets, the global networks of infected computers that cyber criminals enlist to do their bidding.

Math & Statistics Knowledge \\u2013 This knowledge is critical to understand which tools to use, understand the spread and other characteristics to derive insight from the data. Security Data Visualization pingbalaji@gmail.com Security practitioners will be comfortable with domain knowledge and hacking skills. Statistics knowledge is one aspect that security practitioners have to understand to gain insight from data and also to ask the right questions to derive the right security visualization. One resource for statistical knowledge is an online free course \\u201cData to Insight: An Introduction to Data Analysis\\u201d (\\\"Data to Insight: An Introduction to Data Analysis The University of Auckland FutureLearn\\\", 2014). This course is a hands-on introduction to statistical data analysis that emphasizes fundamental concepts and practical skills. This course also introduces the tool iNZight. One aspect google looks at while recruiting engineers is their knowledge on statistics and probability. The reason might be that they need people who understand the basics in deriving value from data. Using statistics, probability in combination with machine learning/artificial intelligence there are lot of predictions based on the data in various fields. Data science field is evolving at a rapid pace. Data visualization is important component of data science. These techniques will soon be applied to information security field for better identification of bad actors. One of the most important advantages of data visualization is that all the resources on data visualization are publicly available for learning the key concepts. There are numerous Coursera and eDX courses available for free about data visualization. There is extensive material about R project with numerous examples from various experts. If enough time is dedicated, data visualization tools and R can be learned easily by security analysts. Security Data Visualization pingbalaji@gmail.com The key advantage for security analysts is that security analysts have access to security data like security metrics data, network traffic data, malware indicators of compromise data, and many more. Security domain expertise is very important before starting data visualization, starting with the right question and the domain expertise will enable to get good output using data visualization. By using data visualization techniques on security data, security analysts can gain be valuable insights on metrics and anomaly detection. Hopefully these insights can make security practitioners jobs easier.

On their own, current natural language processing algorithms are insufficient in performing this task for freight-related queries. High performance machine learning algorithms also require an annotated corpus of named entities which currently does not exist in the freight domain.

Billard and Kragic review the progress made in robotics to emulate these functions. Systems have developed from simple, pinching grippers operating in a fully defined environment, to robots that can identify, select, and manipulate objects from a random collection. Further developments are emerging from advances in computer vision, computer processing capabilities, and tactile materials that give feedback to the robot. Science, this issue p. eaat8414 BACKGROUND Humans have a fantastic ability to manipulate objects of various shapes, sizes, and materials and can control the objects\\u2019 position in confined spaces with the advanced dexterity capabilities of our hands. Building machines inspired by human hands, with the functionality to autonomously pick up and manipulate objects, has always been an essential component of robotics. The first robot manipulators date back to the 1960s and are some of the first robotic devices ever constructed. In these early days, robotic manipulation consisted of carefully prescribed movement sequences that a robot would execute with no ability to adapt to a changing environment. As time passed, robots gradually gained the ability to automatically generate movement sequences, drawing on artificial intelligence and automated reasoning. Robots would stack boxes according to size, weight, and so forth, extending beyond geometric reasoning. This task also required robots to handle errors and uncertainty in sensing at run time, given that the slightest imprecision in the position and orientation of stacked boxes might cause the entire tower to topple. Methods from control theory also became instrumental for enabling robots to comply with the environment\\u2019s natural uncertainty by empowering them to adapt exerted forces upon contact. The ability to stably vary forces upon contact expanded robots\\u2019 manipulation repertoire to more-complex tasks, such as inserting pegs in holes or hammering. However, none of these actions truly demonstrated fine or in-hand manipulation capabilities, and they were commonly performed using simple two-fingered grippers. To enable multipurpose fine manipulation, roboticists focused their efforts on designing humanlike hands capable of using tools. Wielding a tool in-hand became a problem of its own, and a variety of advanced algorithms were developed to facilitate stable holding of objects and provide optimality guarantees. Because optimality was difficult to achieve in a stochastic environment, from the 1990s onward researchers aimed to increase the robustness of object manipulation at all levels. These efforts initiated the design of sensors and hardware for improved control of hand\\u2013object contacts. Studies that followed were focused on robust perception for coping with object occlusion and noisy measurements, as well as on adaptive control approaches to infer an object\\u2019s physical properties, so as to handle objects whose properties are unknown or change as a result of manipulation. ADVANCES Roboticists are still working to develop robots capable of sorting and packaging objects, chopping vegetables, and folding clothes in unstructured and dynamic environments. Robots used for modern manufacturing have accomplished some of these tasks in structured settings that still require fences between the robots and human operators to ensure safety. Ideally, robots should be able to work side by side with humans, offering their strength to carry heavy loads while presenting no danger. Over the past decade, robots have gained new levels of dexterity. This enhancement is due to breakthroughs in mechanics with sensors for perceiving touch along a robot\\u2019s body and new mechanics for soft actuation to offer natural compliance. Most notably, this development leverages the immense progress in machine learning to encapsulate models of uncertainty and support further advances in adaptive and robust control. Learning to manipulate in real-world settings is costly in terms of both time and hardware. To further elaborate on data-driven methods but avoid generating examples with real, physical systems, many researchers use simulation environments. Still, grasping and dexterous manipulation require a level of reality that existing simulators are not yet able to deliver\\u2014for example, in the case of modeling contacts for soft and deformable objects. Two roads are hence pursued: The first draws inspiration from the way humans acquire interaction skills and prompts robots to learn skills from observing humans performing complex manipulation. This allows robots to acquire manipulation capabilities in only a few trials. However, generalizing the acquired knowledge to apply to actions that differ from those previously demonstrated remains difficult. The second road constructs databases of real object manipulation, with the goal to better inform the simulators and generate examples that are as realistic as possible. Yet achieving realistic simulation of friction, material deformation, and other physical properties may not be possible anytime soon, and real experimental evaluation will be unavoidable for learning to manipulate highly deformable objects. OUTLOOK Despite many years of software and hardware development, achieving dexterous manipulation capabilities in robots remains an open problem\\u2014albeit an interesting one, given that it necessitates improved understanding of human grasping and manipulation techniques. We build robots to automate tasks but also to provide tools for humans to easily perform repetitive and dangerous tasks while avoiding harm. Achieving robust and flexible collaboration between humans and robots is hence the next major challenge. Fences that currently separate humans from robots will gradually disappear, and robots will start manipulating objects jointly with humans. To achieve this objective, robots must become smooth and trustable partners that interpret humans\\u2019 intentions and respond accordingly. Furthermore, robots must acquire a better understanding of how humans interact and must attain real-time adaptation capabilities. There is also a need to develop robots that are safe by design, with an emphasis on soft and lightweight structures as well as control and planning methodologies based on multisensory feedback. Holding two objects in one hand requires dexterity. Whereas a human can grab multiple objects at the same time (top), a robot (bottom) cannot yet achieve such dexterity. In this example, a human has placed the objects in the robot\\u2019s hand. PHOTOS: LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS LABORATORY, EPFL Dexterous manipulation is one of the primary goals in robotics. Robots with this capability could sort and package objects, chop vegetables, and fold clothes. As robots come to work side by side with humans, they must also become human-aware. Over the past decade, research has made strides toward these goals. Progress has come from advances in visual and haptic perception and in mechanics in the form of soft actuators that offer a natural compliance. Most notably, immense progress in machine learning has been leveraged to encapsulate models of uncertainty and to support improvements in adaptive and robust control. Open questions remain in terms of how to enable robots to deal with the most unpredictable agent of all, the human.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"9848b6a17eb7d413df947b28622ccdb175397802\", \"abstract\": null}, {\"paperId\": \"e6c08ed103be4ac3a143ebee2226bf6a2553b73e\", \"abstract\": \"While the field of computer vision drives many of todays digital technologies and communication networks, the topic of color has emerged only recently in most computer vision applications.

Breakthrough innovations in areas such as artificial intelligence, workflow automation, and data analytics are eliminating a number of the tedious and labor-intensive manual processes traditionally associated with an audit. More importantly, innovation is enabling auditors to deliver powerful insights that simply weren't possible before. These changes can enhance audit quality and deliver higher value for audit stakeholders--from clients and audit professionals to investors and the capital markets as a whole. (See the article \\\"How to Enable Audit Innovation,\\\" page 33, for details on how Deloitte nurtures in-house ideas to innovate audits.) INSIGHTS ENHANCE QUALITY Automation and other cutting-edge innovations reduce the amount of manual and time-consuming data collection required for an audit. But that's just the beginning. An even bigger benefit of audit innovation is the ability to generate new kinds of insights that increase the value of an audit and bring audit quality to a new level. Powered by innovative technologies and supported by a risk-based methodology, auditors now have more resources, tools, and time to strategically apply their most important skills--professional skepticism and judgment--to business issues, controls, and risks. What's more, auditors are armed with advanced analytical tools to provide deeper insights, including areas beyond the limits of a more traditional audit. For example, using the latest technologies, auditors can analyze complete data sets rather than samples. Advanced tools can be applied to all of a company's contracts related to an area of audit interest, or to metadata about an automated key control. This can reduce audit risk by making it less likely for an unusual transaction to slip through the cracks. Also, given the transformational nature of advanced technologies and analytics, innovative audit tools can readily reveal valuable insights about a business for clients to consider, such as operational inefficiencies and areas for potential improvement. INNOVATIONS RESHAPE THE AUDIT Technology and innovation are advancing at breakneck speed with unprecedented computing power to transform the audit. These advanced technologies, sometimes referred to as \\\"exponentials,\\\" represent technological breakthroughs at the intersection of information technology and science, and they are increasingly a driving force behind audit innovation. Here are some examples of how these exponential technologies and other forms of innovation are powering audits forward and promise a bright future for audit professionals: Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Because AI technologies (also called cognitive technologies) can tackle many tasks performed traditionally by humans, they can enable an audit to avoid the typical trade-offs between speed and quality. Two AI technologies that are especially relevant to audit are natural language processing (NLP), which enables a system to read and understand key concepts in electronic documents, and machine learning, which enables a system to improve itself without being reprogrammed. As audit evidence increasingly becomes more digitized, these technologies, combined with workflow automation, enable auditors to do significantly more analysis in less time. This can allow auditors to spend more time on tasks that add more value to the audit. Workflow automation Through the creative use of technology, many audit activities that previously required time-consuming manual processing by auditors can now be automated. As a result, much of an audit's tedium can be reduced and enable analysis that is faster and more comprehensive. \\u2026\"}, {\"paperId\": \"b1cabd768bc49ae55b0c8bfffb7252c15d3ea039\", \"abstract\": \"The papers in these Proceedings were presented at the Seventeenth ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC'16), held July 24-28, 2016 in Maastricht, The Netherlands.

Current efforts to create value are guided by the triple aim: improve patient outcomes and enhance patient experience while decreasing the cost of care (1). This has prompted a shift toward population health management (PHM), which leverages data-driven technology, effective change management, and workflow optimization to promote sustainable care delivery models (2). Meaningful achievement of these goals represents the greatest challenge of our health care era. Radiology as a profession is no stranger to transformation and reinvention. The field has successfully navigated discrete epochs in its history beginning with Imaging 1.0, a period of discovery from 1920 to 1990 initiated by Wilhelm Roentgen and culminating in a technical revolution with advent of CT and MRI. The widespread picture archiving and communication system implementation in the 1990s ignited a dramatic surge in efficiency and productivity, and the profession flourished as a revenue center in a fee-for-service payment system. However, this era is referred to as the dark era of Imaging 2.0 because of the unintended consequences of increased isolation from our patients, health care teams, and referring providers. In recognition of this void in the evolving practice of radiology, the Imaging 3.0 campaign was launched to foster collaboration between radiologists, patients, referring physicians, and other key stakeholders in the pursuit of appropriate, evidence-based imaging and management (3). Born in a military setting, over-the-horizon radar systems were developed during the Cold War to improve safety by increasing time available for protective action by detecting threats long before traditional radar or line of sight. The rapidly changing health care environment and advent of technologies evoke an analogous need and vision for radiology. It is thus appropriate to speculate about the next era to shape our collective preparation and response. The breakneck pace of advances in data science and the inability of the legacy health care system to meet increasingly complex demands has led many thought leaders in the field to identify artificial intelligence (AI) as this next frontier. In general terms, AI allows machines to process information, recognize patterns, and refine existing models to learn, solve problems, and perform specific tasks. This iterative process relies on machine learning, which leverages self-correcting algorithms to interpret vast amounts of data and make rapid predictions (4). The concept of AI and uncertainty around its impact understandably create angst for some radiologists.

Anonymity also makes it more difficult for scholars, historians, practitioners, political commentators, and\\u2014in the thirty-nine states with elected judges and justices\\u2014the electorate, to glean valuable information about legal decisionmakers and the way they make their decisions. The value of determining authorship for unsigned opinions has long been recognized but, until now, the methods of doing so have been cumbersome, imprecise, and altogether unsatisfactory. Our work uses natural language processing to predict authorship of judicial opinions that are unsigned or whose attribution is disputed. Using a dataset of Supreme Court opinions with known authorship, we identify key words and phrases that can, to a high degree of accuracy, predict authorship. Thus, our method makes accessible an important class of cases heretofore inaccessible. For illustrative purposes, we explain our process as applied to the Obamacare decision, in which the authorship of a joint dissent was subject to significant popular speculation. We conclude with a chart predicting the author of every unsigned per curiam opinion during the Roberts Court.

Traditional methods are often inadequate not merely because of the size in bytes of the data sets, but also because of the complexity of modern data sets. Mathematical limitations of familiar algorithms and techniques in dealing with such data sets create a critical need for new paradigms for the representation, analysis and scientific visualization (as opposed to illustrative visualization) of heterogeneous, multiresolution data across application domains. Some of the problems presented by the new data sets have been addressed by other disciplines such as applied mathematics, statistics and machine learning and have been utilized by other sciences such as space-based geosciences. Unfortunately, valuable results pertaining to these problems are mostly to be found in publications outside of astronomy. Here we offer brief overviews of a number of concepts, techniques and developments that are vital to the analysis and visualization of complex datasets and images. One of the goals of this paper is to help bridge the gap between applied mathematics and artificial intelligence on the one side and astronomy on the other.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"ab95f9e5697a7619da9b4a8dbf81f338f2b2ec21\", \"abstract\": \"We consider the use of intelligent systems to address the long-standing medical problem of diagnostic differentiation between harmful (secondary) and benign (primary) headache conditions. In secondary headaches, conditions are caused by an underlying pathology, in contrast to primary headaches where the production of pain represents the sole constituent of the disorder. Conventional diagnostic paradigms carry an unacceptable risk of misdiagnosis, leaving patients open to potentially catastrophic consequences. Intelligent systems approaches, grounded in artificial intelligence, are adopted in this study as a potential means to unite contributions from multiple settings, including medicine, the life sciences, pervasive computation, sensor technologies, and autonomous intelligent agency, in the fight against headache uncertainty. In this paper, we therefore present the first steps in our research towards a data intensive, unified approach to headache dichotomisation. We begin by presenting a background to headache and its classification, followed by analysis of the space of confounding symptoms, in addition to the problem of primary and secondary condition discrimination. Finally, we proceed to report results of a preliminary case study, in which the epileptic seizure is considered as a manifestation of a headache confounding neuropathology. It was found that our classification approach, based on supervised machine learning, represents a promising direction, with a best area under curve test outcome of 0.915. We conclude that intelligent systems, in conjunction with biosignals, could be suitable for classification of a more general set of pathologies, while facilitating the medicalisation of arbitrary settings.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"c59f6b9b3644bd776433828aa88c6c0d00f42622\", \"abstract\": \"Expert systems are part of a general category of computer applications known as intelligence. Expert system are designed to solve complex problems. Expert Systems is a branch of AI designed to work within a particular domain. To solve expert-level problems, expert systems will need efficient access to a substantial domain knowledge base, and a reasoning mechanism to apply the knowledge to the problems they are given. Usually they will also need to be able to explain, to the users who rely on them, how they have reached their decisions. As an expert is a person who can solve a problem with the domain knowledge. This research paper introduces introduction, parts, application of expert system. and difference between forward chaining and Backward chaining and Exactly meaning of Chaining. ETL tools uses functionality to extract, transform and load data from one system into another system, but our expert advises they're not optimal for application-to-application communication. In artificial intelligence, an expert system is a computer system that emulates the decision-making ability of a human expert. The AI technology has become really advanced and its only matter of time when the machines will be able to learn almost anything. The machine learning algorithms are already very smart, however the Processing power has been a challenge in last decade .Now with the big data and distributed computing revolution this problem has become easy to solve. Many programmers and developers can start programming their own robots and other gadgets on their own. Artificial intelligence is a science and technology based on disciplines such as Computer Science, Biology, Psychology, Linguistics, Mathematics, and Engineering. A major thrust of AI is in the development of computer functions associated with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem solving.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"9fd6621c52fbfff2778448515a83df000358597e\", \"abstract\": \"In 1989, B. F. Skinner told Joseph Rychlak that the greatest disappointment resulting from the 'cognitive revolution' was the turning of the human organism into a machine. Intrigued by this statement, Rychlak decided that after many years of formulation it was time to present his fundamentally teleological view of the human being, which he calls the 'logical learning theory' (LLT). In this new theoretical perspective the author re-presents such concepts as intention, purpose, and free will. Significant aspects of the 'mind-body' issue are explored here. Rychlak addresses teleological issues and provides a language for proper conceptualization. He uses experimental findings to support the notion of behavior as self-directed rather than mechanistic.In the process, Rychlak places LLT on the side of teleological explanation, in which concepts like free will, self-choice, purpose and intention are no longer dismissed. Rychlak compares LLT and existing formulations of behavior, including classical and operant conditioning, social learning theory, social constructionism, cognitive science, gestalt theories, and personality theories. Extensive research data and thorough discussions support Rychlak's theory. A glossary is also included. Joseph F. Rychlak is Maude C.

However, full exploitation is slowed by a lack of control over synthesis. Despite the two decades since the explosion of work in the area, progress in controlled production of nanotubes is impeded by our lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of nucleation and growth. Our group has endeavored to develop a method that addresses the critical bottlenecks impeding the speed of research by taking advantage of advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, data sciences and in-situ/in-operando characterization. Our Autonomous Research System, ARES, is capable of designing, executing and evaluating its own CNT growth experiments. Artificial intelligence module based on random tree / genetic algorithm statistical approach analyses experimentally obtained kinetic parameters (rate, time constant, etc.) and proposes new experiments to achieve user-defined objective. These are then executed by ARES automatically and without human intervention, and fed back into the AI module to ensure machine learning. Recent experiments utilized maximum growth rate as an objective. The normalized difference between the objective and experimentally observed growth rates behaves in a fashion similar to what is typically seen in the control systems, with experimentally observed growth rate oscillating around the target. The convergence can be expressed via cumulative root mean square (RMS) of the rate difference. RMS increases initially (divergence), followed by consistent decrease after ~50 experiments, indicating convergence. That is, after some unsuccessful experimentation, ARES was better able to supply experimental conditions that achieved the objective growth rate. We take this as a clear demonstration of autonomous AI learning: convergence on the objective via closed-loop iterative experimentation without human intervention.\"}, {\"paperId\": \"eb9e1a33d206be45bd955504a05ae313a42e472e\", \"abstract\": \"The ability to recognize the plans and goals of other agents enables humans to reason about what other people are doing, why they are doing it, and what they will do next. This fundamental cognitive capability is also critical to interpersonal interactions because human communications presuppose an ability to understand the motivations of the participants and subjects of the discussion. As the complexity of human-machine interactions increases and automated systems become more intelligent, we strive to provide them with comparable intent recognition capabilities. Research addressing this problem is variously referred to as plan recognition, activity recognition, goal recognition, and intent recognition. This synergistic research area combines techniques from user modeling, computer vision, natural language understanding, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning. Plan recognition algorithms play a crucial role in a wide variety of applications including smart homes, intelligent user interfaces, personal agent assistants, human-robot interaction, and video surveillance. Plan recognition research in computer science dates back at least thirty-five years, initially defined in a paper by Schmidt, Sridharan, and Goodson [64]. In the last ten years, significant new advances have been made on this problem by researchers in artificial intelligence and related areas. These advances have been driven by three primary factors: first, the pressing need for sophisticated and efficient plan recognition systems in a wide variety of applications; second, the development of new algorithmic techniques in probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and optimization (combined with more powerful computers to use these techniques); and finally, our increased ability to gather data about human activities. Recent research in the field is often divided into two subareas. \\u201cActivity recognition\\u201d focuses on the problem of dealing directly with noisy low-level data gathered by physical sensors such as cameras, wearable sensors, and instrumented user interfaces. The primary task in this space is to discover and extract interesting patterns in noisy sensory data that can be interpreted as meaningful activities.
